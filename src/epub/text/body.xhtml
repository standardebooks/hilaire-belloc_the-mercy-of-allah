  <small>ENTITLED <i>AL-RAFSAT</i>, OR THE KICK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">In</span>
the days of Abd-er-Rahman, who was among
the wisest and most glorious of the Commanders
of the Faithful, there resided in the City
of Bagdad an elderly merchant of such enormous
wealth that his lightest expressions of opinion
caused the markets of the Euphrates to fluctuate
in the most alarming manner.</p>

<p>This merchant, whose name was Mahmoud, had
a brother in the middle ranks of Society, a surgeon
by profession, and by name El-Hakim. To this
brother he had frequently expressed a fixed determination
to leave him no wealth of any kind. “It
is my opinion,” he would say, “that a man’s first
duty is to his own children, and though I have no
children myself, I must observe the general rule.”
He was fond of dilating upon this subject whenever
he came across his relative, and would
discover from time to time new and still better
reasons for the resolution he had arrived at. His
brother received with great courtesy the prospect
held out to him by the wealthy merchant; but one
day, finding tedious the hundredth repetition of
that person’s pious but somewhat wearisome resolve,
said to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mahmoud, though it would be a mean and even
an impious thing to expect an inheritance from
you to any of my seven sons, yet perhaps you will
allow these boys to receive from your lips some
hint as to the manner in which you have accumulated
that great wealth which you now so
deservedly enjoy.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” said Mahmoud, who was ever
ready to describe his own talents and success.
“Send the little fellows round to me to-morrow
about the hour the public executions take place
before the Palace, for by that time I shall have
breakfasted, and shall be ready to receive them.”</p>

<p>The Surgeon, with profuse thanks, left his
brother and conveyed the good news to the seven
lads, who stood in order before him with the
respect for parents customary in the Orient, each
placed according to his size and running in gradation
from eight to sixteen years of age.</p>

<p>Upon the morrow, therefore, the Surgeon’s
seven sons, seated gravely upon crossed legs,
formed a semi-circle at the feet of their revered
relative, who, when he had watched them humorously
and in silence for some moments, puffing at
his great pipe, opened his lips and spoke as
follows:</p>

<p>“Your father has wondered, my dear nephews,
in what way the fortune I enjoy has been acquired;
for in his own honourable but far from lucrative
walk of life, sums which are to me but daily trifles
appear like the ransoms of kings. To you, his
numerous family, it seems of especial advantage
that the road to riches should be discovered. Now
I will confess to you, my dear lads, that I am quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
ignorant of any rule or plan whereby the
perishable goods of this world may be rapidly
accumulated in the hands of the Faithful. Nay,
did any such rule exist, I am persuaded that by
this time the knowledge of it would be so widely
diffused as to embrace the whole human race. In
which case,” he added, puffing meditatively at his
pipe, “all would cancel out and no result would be
achieved; since a great fortune, as I need not
inform young people of your sagacity, is hardly
to be acquired save at the expense of others.</p>

<p>“But though I cannot give you those rules for
which your father was seeking when he sent you
hither, I can detail you the steps by which my
present affluence was achieved; and each of you,
according to his intelligence, will appreciate what
sort of accidents may make for the increase of
fortune. When you are possessed of this knowledge
it will serve you through life for recreation
and amusement, though I very much doubt its
making you any richer. For it is not the method
nor even the opportunity of intelligent acquisition
which lead to great riches, but two other things
combined: one, the unceasing appetite to snatch
and hold from all and at every season; the other,
that profound mystery, the Mercy of God.</p>

<p>“For Allah, in his inscrutable choice, frowns on
some and smiles on others. The first he condemns
to contempt, anxiety, duns, bills, Courts of law,
sudden changes of residence and even dungeons;
the second he gratifies with luxurious vehicles,
delicious sherbet and enormous houses, such as
mine. His will be done.</p>

<p>“A dear friend of mine, one Mashé, was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
receiver of stolen goods in Bosra, until God took
him, now twenty years ago. He left two sons of
equal intelligence and rapacity. The one, after
numerous degradations, died of starvation in
Armenia; the other, of no greater skill, is to-day
governor of all Algeirah and rings the changes at
will upon the public purse. <i>Mektub.</i>”</p>

<p>For a moment the ancient Captain of Industry
paused with bent head in solemn meditation upon
the designs of Heaven, then raising his features
protested that he had too long delayed the story
of his life, with which he would at once proceed.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“As a boy, my dear nephews,” began the kindly
uncle, while his dutiful nephews regarded him
with round eyes, “I was shy, dirty, ignorant, lazy,
and wilful. My parents and teachers had but to
give me an order for me to conceive at once some
plan of disobeying it. All forms of activity save
those connected with dissipation were abhorrent
to me. So far from reciting with other boys of
my age in chorus and without fault the verses of
the Koran, I grew up completely ignorant of that
work, the most Solemn Name in which I to this
day pronounce with an aspirate from an unfamiliarity
with its aspect upon the written page. Yet
I am glad to say that I never neglected my religious
duties, that I prayed with fervour and regularity,
and that I had a singular faith in the loving
kindness of my God.</p>

<p>“I had already reached my seventeenth year
when my father, who had carefully watched the
trend of my nature and the use to which I had put
my faculties, addressed me as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Mahmoud, I wish you no ill. I have so far
fed and clothed you because the Caliph (whom
Allah preserve!) has caused those who neglect
their younger offspring to be severely beaten upon
the soles of their feet. It is now my intention to
send you about your business. I propose’—and
here my dear father pulled out a small purse—‘to
give you the smallest sum compatible with
my own interests, so that if any harm befall
you, the vigilant officers of the Crown cannot
ascribe your disaster to my neglect. I request
that you will walk in any direction you choose
so only that it be in a straight line away from
my doors. If, when this your patrimony is spent,
you make away with yourself I shall hold you
to blame; I shall be better pleased to hear
that you have sold yourself into slavery or in
some other way provided for your continued sustenance.
But what I should like best would be
never to hear of you again.’ With those words
my father (your grandfather, dear boys), seizing
me by the shoulders, turned my back to his doors
and thrust me forth with a hearty kick the better
to emphasize his meaning.</p>

<p>“Thus was I launched out in the dawn of manhood
to try my adventures with the world.</p>

<p>“I discovered in my pouch as I set out along
the streets of the city the sum of 100 dinars, with
which my thoughtful parent had provided me
under the legal compulsion which he so feelingly
described. ‘With so large a capital,’ said I to
myself, ‘I can exist for several days, indulge my
favourite forms of dissipation, and when they
are well spent it will be time enough to think of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
some experiment whereby to replace them.’”</p>

<p>Here the eldest nephew said respectfully and
with an inclination of the head: “Pray, uncle,
what is a dinar?”</p>

<p>“My dear lad,” replied the merchant with a
merry laugh, “I confess that to a man of my
position a reply to your question is impossible. I
could only tell you that it is a coin of considerable
value to the impoverished, but to men like myself
a denomination so inferior as to be indistinguishable
from all other coins.”</p>

<p>Having so expressed himself the worthy merchant
resumed the thread of his tale:</p>

<p>“I had, I say, started forward in high spirits to
the sound of the coins jingling in my pouch, when
my steps happened to take to the water-side,
where I found a ship about to sail for the Persian
Gulf. ‘Here,’ said I to myself, ‘is an excellent
opportunity for travelling and for seeing the
world.’</p>

<p>“The heat of the day was rising. No one was
about but two watermen, who lay dozing upon the
bank. I nimbly stepped aboard and hid myself
behind one of the bales of goods with which the
deck was packed. When the sun declined and
work was resumed, the sailors tramped aboard,
the sail was hoisted, and we started upon our
journey.</p>

<p>“Befriended by the darkness of night I crept
out quietly from my hiding-place and found a
man watching over the prow, where he was
deputed to try the depth of the water from time
to time with a long pole. I affected an air of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
authority, and told him that the Captain had
sent me forward to deliver his commands, which
were that he should give me a flask of wine, some
fruit, and a cake (for I guessed that like all
sailors he had in his possession things both lawful
and unlawful). These I told him I would
take to my relative the Captain. He left me
with the pole for a moment and soon returned
with the provisions, with which I crept back
to my hiding-place, and there heartily consumed
them.</p>

<p>“During the whole of the next day I lay sleeping
behind the bales of goods. With the fall of
the second night I needed a second meal. I dared
not repeat my first experiment, and lay musing
till, hunger having sharpened my wits, I hit upon
a plan with which surely Providence itself must
have inspired a poor lonely lad thrown in his
unaided weakness upon a cruel world.</p>

<p>“I bethought me that the watchman of either
board would have some provision for the night.
I remembered a sort of gangway between the
high bales upon the main deck, which corridor
led back far under the poop into the stern sheets.
It has been so designed for the convenience of
stowing and unloading, affording a passage for
the workmen as they handled the cargo. I put
these two things together in my mind (but to God
be the glory) and formed of them a plan for
immediate execution.</p>

<p>“I crept from my hiding-place and sauntered
along the dark deck until I came upon the watchman,
squatting by the rail, and contemplating
the stars in the moonless sky. He had, as I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
suspected, a platter the white of which I could
just see glimmering against the deck beside him.
I thought I also discerned a gourd of wine. I
approached him as one of the crew (for they
were chance strangers taken on at the wharf).
We talked in low tones of the girls of Bagdad,
of the police, of opportunities for theft, and of
such other topics as are common to the poor, till,
naturally, we came to wine. He cursed the poor
quality of his own, in the gourd beside him. I,
after some mystery, confided to him that I had
a stock of excellent wine, and, as my friendship
for him increased, I made a clean breast of it
and told him it was in the stern sheets, far under
the poop deck along the narrow passage between
the high bales. I offered to go with him and fetch
it, allowing him, in his eagerness, to go first.
When he was well engaged in groping aft I turned,
crept forward again silently and rapidly, picked
up the loaf and cheese which I found on his platter,
as also the gourd, and vanished into my
hiding-hole.</p>

<p>“I ate my fill—though somewhat too hurriedly,
and remarked how long a time my shipmate was
spending at searching that empty place. As I
heard him creeping back at last cursing violently
in whispers, I was aware of faint dawn in
the East, and determined that my cruise must end.</p>

<p>“We were already in the neighbourhood of the
sea, as I discovered by tasting the water over the
side in the darkness and discovering it to be brackish.
I bethought me that my poor comrade had
now an excellent reason for ferretting me out, that
the Captain also would soon hear of me and that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
with daylight, I should certainly be visited with a
bastinado or put into chains and sold. I therefore
slipped over the side (for I was an excellent swimmer)
and made for the shore. There I lay on a
warm beach and watched through the reeds the
great sail of the ship as it slipped down-stream
further and further away in the growing light.</p>

<p>“When the sun rose the vessel was out of sight,
and looking about me I discovered a little village
not far from the shore inhabited by simple fishermen,
but containing several houses of some pretension,
the residences of wealthy merchants who
came here from Bosra in their moments of leisure
to relax themselves from the catch-as-catch-can of
commerce in that neighbouring city.</p>

<p>“My first action at the opening of the new day
was to fall upon my knees and add to the ritual
prayer a humble outpouring of thanks for the
benefits I had already received and a fervent
appeal for guidance. That appeal was heard. I
rose from my knees full of a new-found plan.</p>

<p>“To one of those wealthier houses which stood
near the village I at once proceeded and sent in a
message by a slave to its owner saying that my
master, a wealthy dealer in carpets, solicited the
custom of his lordship, and that if the great man
would but accompany me to the quay I would there
show him wares well worthy of his attention.</p>

<p>“It so happened (and here was Providence
again at work) that this merchant had a passion
for a particular sort of carpet which is solely made
by the inhabitants of El Kzar, for they alone possess
the secret, which they very zealously guard.
The slave, therefore, brought me back the message<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
that his master would not be at the pains of accompanying
me unless such wares were present for
his inspection. If my carpets were those of El
Kzar he would willingly inspect them, but if they
were of any other brand he was indifferent.</p>

<p>“And let this teach you, my dear nephews, how
simple are the minds of the rich.</p>

<p>“I was willing enough that the carpets should
be carpets of El Kzar, or, indeed, of any other
place under heaven, for all were at my choice.</p>

<p>“I hastened, therefore, to send back a further
message that by a curious coincidence we had upon
this occasion nothing else in stock but Kzaran carpets,
and begged the slave to emphasize this important
point to his master.</p>

<p>“His reply was to twist his right hand, palm
upwards, with a strange smile. I pulled out my
purse, showed him the shining dinars, and asked
him whether he would rather have <i>one</i> now for his
fee or <i>five</i> on the completion of the transaction?
With glistening eyes—and even (as I thought) a
pathetic gratitude—the slave leapt at the latter
offer.</p>

<p>“And let this teach you, my dear nephews, how
simple are the minds of the poor.</p>

<p>“He hastened off to deliver my message.</p>

<p>“Within a few moments the master of the house
appeared in great haste, and all of a fever bade
me lead him to the appointed spot.”</p>

<p>At this moment the merchant paused and with
reverie and reminiscence in his eye remained silent
for at least that space of time in which a
dexterous pick-pocket may gingerly withdraw a
purse from the sleeve of a Holy Man. The sec<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>ond
nephew thought the opportunity arrived to
suggest a doubt which had been vexing his young
mind. He said with an obeisance:</p>

<p>“Venerable uncle, we have listened to the beginnings
of your career with admiration and respect,
but we are more perplexed than ever to discover
how such beginnings could have led to such an end.
For you appear to us as yet only to have followed
that path which leads to the torturers and the bow-strings.”</p>

<p>“Such,” replied his uncle, with a look of singular
affection, “is the general opinion entertained
of all very wealthy men in the first steps of their
careers; but I hope that the sequel will teach you
and your clever little brothers how wrongly informed
are the vulgar.”</p>

<p>As the Merchant Mahmoud pronounced these
words the Call to Prayer was heard from a neighbouring
tower, and he hurriedly concluded:</p>

<p>“My dear nephews, we are called to prayer. I
will cease here to speak and will continue
to-morrow the story of Myself and Providence.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing these words his seven nephews
rose together, and crossed their arms; following
which gesture, with three deep bows performed as
they walked backwards toward the curtains of the
magnificent apartment, they left their uncle’s
presence.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“You will remember, my dear nephews,” said
the Merchant Mahmoud when the lads were once
more assembled in a half-circle before him with
crossed legs and attentive countenances, “that you
left me hurrying with the collector of Kzaran car<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>pets
towards the quay where he should enjoy the
sight of the merchandise. This merchant was
reputed among the people of the place to be of a
singularly cunning and secretive temperament, a
character which (you may think it strange!) they
admired as though it were the summit of human
wisdom. I confess that I found him, in the matter
of Kzaran carpets at least, very different from his
reputation. A more garrulous old gentleman
never trod this earth. He was in a perpetual
stammer of excitement, and though I was careful
to lead him by the most roundabout roads that he
might have time to cool his ardour, the delay did
but seem to increase it.</p>

<p>“‘I implore you, sir,’ he said at last, as one
who could no longer restrain some violent passion,
‘I implore you, pay no attention to others in this
place who may have attempted to forestall me in
the matter of your very valuable cargo. Your
honour is, I know, sufficient in the matter.... I
am confident you will give me a free market. Also,
they know nothing of Kzaran carpets in these
parts: they are mere buyers and sellers ... and
on what a margin! Let me tell you in your ear that
while many men in this place carry on the appearance
of riches, most are indebted to Parsees in
the capital. I alone am in an independent position
and’ (here he whispered) ‘I can well reward you
<i>privately</i> and <i>in your own pocket</i> for any favour
you may show me.’</p>

<p>“Seeing him so eager, I affected a certain hesitation
and embarrassment, and at last confessed
that I had been approached by a local merchant
whose name I was forbidden to mention and who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
had very kindly sent me as a present by a slave
the sum of 1,000 dinars. To this he had attached
no conditions, but he had also, quite independently,
sent word that he had himself orders for carpets
which he was bound to fulfil. His profit (he had
said), if I would give him a first choice, would be
so considerable that he would be very ready to
offer me a handsome commission on the completion
of the bargain; quite apart from the 1,000
dinars which were but a little present from one
man to another. ‘This thousand dinars,’ I added,
‘now in my possession, I have accepted. A present
is a graceful act and can be taken with a clean
conscience. But the <i>commission</i> is another matter.
I must consider beyond everything the interests of
my master. I shall not mention the offer made to
me (for with all his confidence in me he is himself
a business man and might misunderstand my position),
but I shall think it my duty to give him no
advice save to sell to the highest bidder.’</p>

<p>“‘It is I!’ shouted the aged connoisseur eagerly,
‘it is I who will prove the highest bidder! Nay,
my dear fellow, since such bargains are often concluded
in private, would it not be better to tell
your master forthwith that no possible competitor
can stand against me in this place? Let him first
discover the sum offered by my rival and I give
you leave to suggest a sum larger by one-tenth,
which shall decide his judgment. Meanwhile,’ he
added, ‘two thousand dinars are but a small present
for one in your position, and I shall willingly—joyfully—propose
to give you that sum, not for a
moment on account of the service which I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
certain you design to do me, but purely as an
expression of my esteem.’</p>

<p>“His excitement had now so risen that I fear
his judgment was lost. Already he saw before him
in his mind’s eye a pile of the noblest Kzaran
carpets, all ready for the caravan. Already he
saw a rival calmly acquiring them on the distant
wharf, the witnesses placing their seals, the words
of completion.</p>

<p>“He trembled as again he urged on me the little
gift, the personal gift, the trifling gift of 2,000
dinars.</p>

<p>“‘Sir,’ said I in reply, a little stiffly, ‘I am not
accustomed to take secret commissions under any
disguise. My duty is clear: if I cannot receive a
firm offer superior to that already made me, and
that backed with proof that you are indeed, as you
say, the most solid man in the place—then I must
close with my first client. If indeed I were certain
of an immediate payment in a larger sum I would
accept your proposal. But how can I know anything
of this place? The thousand dinars of which
I spoke are coined and in a wallet; I have them
safe. With all the respect due to your age, I have
no information upon your credit in this town. And
I confess,’ I added in another tone, ‘that I <i>am</i>
acquainted with your rival’s position, which is
perhaps more solid than you think. I confess I
think it would be simpler and to the better interest
of our house if I were to go straight to him now
and have done with it.’</p>

<p>“As I spoke thus the old man lost all reason.
It was piteous to see one of his age and venerable
hairs dancing and spluttering with excitement.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
He shook his fists in the air, he called to Heaven
in shrill tones, he betrayed all the frenzy of the
collector. He contrasted the mercantile motives
of the unknown competitor with his own passion
for Pure Art. He called Heaven to witness to the
reality of his wealth, and at last in a sort of fury
tore from his garments the jewels which ornamented
them, thrust into my hand all the cash
upon his person (it was in a leather bag, and
amounted altogether to no more than 500 dinars),
added to this a brooch of gold, which he dragged
from his scarf, and said that if this instalment
were not a sufficient proof of his good faith and
credit he knew not how to move me.</p>

<p>“I shrugged my shoulders and suggested that
instead of making so violent a protestation and at
such risk to his fortune he should go back soberly
to his house and return with an instrument of
credit and two witnesses (as the law demands),
while I awaited him patiently at that spot. I, at
least, was in no haste and would honourably abide
his return. He was off at a speed which I should
never have thought possible at his age.</p>

<p>“I waited until he had turned the corner of a
distant hedge of prickly pears, and not until he
was quite out of sight did I gather the jewels, the
coins, and the precious ornaments which in his
haste he had thrown at my feet, and very rapidly
betake myself in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“Never was the Mercy of Allah more evidently
extended. The plain was naked outside the town,
the river perhaps a mile distant; my plight, as it
might appear, desperate. I pinned the gold brooch
to my cloak, I distributed the jewels openly upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
various parts of my person, and I proceeded at a
smart pace over the open plain towards the river.
It was with the greatest joy that I found upon its
bank two fishermen about to set sail and proceed
down-stream to sea. Their presence inspired me
with a plan for escape.</p>

<p>“I chatted negligently with them (still keeping
one eye upon the distant house of my aged but
excitable friend). At last with a light laugh I
offered one of them a piece of gold, saying that I
should be pleased to try the novel experience of a
little cruise. The fisherman, who was quite unacquainted
with so much wealth, and seemed somewhat
awestruck, gave me some grand title or
other, and promised me very good sport with the
fish and a novel entertainment. But even as he
and his companion pushed out from shore I turned
in my seat on the deck and perceived in the plain
a rising dust which betrayed the approach of the
merchant with his witnesses and a company of
his slaves.</p>

<p>“Suddenly changing my expression from one of
pleased though wearied expectancy to one of acute
alarm, I shouted to my new companions: ‘Push
away for your lives, and stretch your sail to its
utmost! These are the Commissioners sent by
the Caliph to re-assess and tax all fishing-boats
upon a new valuation! Already had they seized
three upon the beach when I left and found you
here!’</p>

<p>“At these words the worthy fellows were
inspired by a fear even greater than my own.
They manfully pushed into the swiftest part of
the current, and, though a smart breeze was blow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>ing,
hoisted every inch of the sail, so that the boat
ran with her gunwale upon the very edge of the
water and was indeed dangerously pressed. But
I had the satisfaction of seeing the merchant and
his retinue vainly descending the river-bank, at
perhaps one-half our speed, calling down curses
upon us, threatening with their fists, shouting
their public titles of authority, their menaces of
the law, and in every way confirming my excellent
pair of fishermen in the story I had told them.</p>

<p>“It was a pleasant thing to loll on deck under
the heat of the day, toying with the valuable ornaments
I had so recently acquired and lazily watching
my companions as they sweated at the halyards,
or alternatively glancing along towards the
shore at the little group of disappointed people
which fell so rapidly behind us as we bowled down
the tide. Soon their features were no longer
plain, then their figures could scarcely be distinguished.
The last impression conveyed to me was
of some little very distant thing, stamping with
impotent rage and shaking wild arms against the
sky. I could not but deplore so grievous a lapse
in dignity in one so venerable.</p>

<p>“When we were well away from the neighbourhood
of the city I asked the fishermen whither they
were bound; to which they answered that their
business was only to cruise about outside and fish
during the night, returning at dawn with their
catch. ‘Would it not be better,’ I suggested, ‘seeing
that these rapacious fellows will hang about
for a day or so, to carry me to some town of your
acquaintance along the coast where the reigning
powers do not suffer from the tyranny of Bagdad?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
For my part I am free to travel where I will, and
the prospect of a change pleases me. I shall be
happy,’ said I, ‘to reward the sacrifice of your
catch with fifty dinars.’</p>

<p>“At the prospect of much further wealth the
fishermen were at once convinced: they sang in
the lightness of their hearts, and for three days
and three nights we sped down the Gulf, passing
bleak mountains and deserted rocky promontories,
until upon the fourth day we came to a town the
like of which I had never seen.</p>

<p>“‘Shall we land here?’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said the fishermen, ‘for it is in a manner
within the Caliph’s dominions, and perhaps
that accursed tax of which you spoke will be
levied here also.’</p>

<p>“‘You know better than I,’ replied I thoughtfully,
standing for a moment in affected perplexity.
‘Let me, however, land in your little boat. I
have a passion for new places. I will come out to
you again after the hour of the mid-day prayers,
while you stand in the offing.’</p>

<p>“To this arrangement they readily consented.
I rowed to the land, and when I had reached the
shore I was pleased to see my fearful hosts quite
three miles out upon the hot and shimmering sea.
Gazing at them, I hope with charity, and certainly
with interest, I pushed the little boat adrift (for
I had no reason to return to those poor people)
and made my way inland. I disposed of my
jewelery at prices neither low nor high with local
merchants. I preserved the old fellow’s golden
brooch, which I imagined (for I am a trifle weak
and superstitious) might bring me good fortune,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and when all my transactions were accomplished
I counted my total capital, and found myself in
possession of no less than 1,500 dinars. The cold
of the evening had come by the time my accounts
were settled and the strings of my pouch were
drawn. I set myself under an arbour where a delicious
fountain played in the light of the setting
sun, which shone over the waters of the sea, and
drinking some local beverage the name of which
I knew not, but the taste and effect of which were
equally pleasing, I reflected upon my increase of
fortune.</p>

<p>“‘You left home, Mahmoud,’ said I to myself,
‘with one hundred dinars, of which your excellent
and careful father deprived himself rather than
see you face the world unarmed, or himself receive
the bastinado. You have been gone from home a
week; you are perhaps some 800 miles from your
native city; your capital has been multiplied
fifteen-fold, and so far you may look with an eager
courage towards the further adventures of your
life, for very clearly the Mercy of Allah is upon
you.’”</p>

<p>At this moment a nasal hooting from the neighbourhood
turret warned the company to turn their
thoughts to heaven. The boys, who had sat fascinated
by their uncle’s recital, knew that the end of
their entertainment had come. The third son of
the Surgeon was therefore impatient to exclaim
(as he hurriedly did): “But, dear uncle, though
we see that a certain chance favoured you, and
not only your native talents, yet we do not perceive
how all this led to any main road to fortune.”</p>

<p>“My boy,” said the Merchant Mahmoud, pen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>sively
stroking his beard and gazing vacuously
over the heads of the youngsters. “I do not pretend
to unfold you any such plan. Have I not told
you that did such a plan exist all would be in possession
of it? I am but retailing you in my humble
fashion the steps by which one merchant in this
city has been raised by the Infinite Goodness of
the Merciful (His named be adored!) from poverty
to riches.... But the call for prayer has
already been heard and we must part. Upon this
same day of next week, shortly after the last of
the public executions has been bungled, you shall
again come and hear me recite the next chapter of
my varied career.”</p>

  <small>ENTITLED <i>AL-DURAR</i>, OR THE PEARLS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">A week</span>
later, at the hour of Public Executions
and Beheadings, the seven boys were
again assembled cross-legged at the feet of their
revered uncle, who, when he had refreshed them
with cold water, and himself with a curious concoction
of fermented barley, addressed them as follows:</p>

<p>“You will remember, my lads, how I was left cut
off from my dear home and from all companions,
in a strange country, and with no more than 1,500
dinars with which to face the world. This sum
may seem to you large, but I can assure you that
to the operations of commerce” (and here the
merchant yawned) “it is but a drop in the ocean;
and I had already so far advanced during one
brief week in my character of Financier that I
gloomily considered how small a sum that 1,500
was wherewith to meet the cunning, the gluttony,
and the avarice of this great world. But a brief
sleep (which I took under a Baobab tree to save
the cost of lodging) refreshed at once my body
and my intelligence, and with the next morning
I was ready to meet the world.”</p>

<p>Here the merchant coughed slightly, and addressing
his nephews said: “You have doubtless
been instructed at school upon the nature of the
Baobab?”</p>

<p>“We have,” replied his nephews, and they recited
in chorus the descriptions which they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
been taught by heart from the text-books of their
Academy.</p>

<p>“I am pleased,” replied their uncle, smiling, “to
discover you thus informed. You will appreciate
how ample a roof this singular vegetable affords.</p>

<p>“Well, I proceeded under the morning sun
through a pleasantly wooded and rising country,
considering by what contrivance of usury or deceit
I might next increase my capital, when I saw
in the distance the groves and white buildings of
an unwalled town, to which (since large places,
especially if they are not war-like, furnish the best
field for the enterprise of a Captain of Industry)
I proceeded; ... and there, by the Mercy of
Allah, there befell me as singular an adventure as
perhaps ever has fallen to the lot of man.</p>

<p>“I had not taken up my place in the local caravanserai
for more than an hour—I had met no
likely fool, and my plans for the future were still
vague in my head—when an old gentleman of great
dignity, followed by an obsequious officer and no
less than six Ethiopian slaves, approached me with
deep reverence, and profferring me a leathern
pouch, of a foreign kind, the like of which I had
never seen before, asked me whether I were not
the young man who had inadvertently left it upon
a prayer-stone at a shrine outside the city.</p>

<p>“I seized the pouch with an eager air, held it
up in transports of joy, and kissing it again and
again said, ‘Oh! my benefactor! How can I sufficiently
thank you! It is my father’s last gift to
me and is all my viaticum as well!’ with which I
fell to kissing and fondling it again, pressing it to
my heart and so discovered it to be filled with
coins—as indeed I had suspected it to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Into so active an emotion had I roused myself
that my eyes filled with tears, and the good old
man himself was greatly affected. ‘I must warn
you, young stranger,’ he said paternally, ‘against
this thoughtlessness so common in youth! A great
loss indeed had it been for you, if we had not had
the good fortune to recover your property.’</p>

<p>“You may imagine my confusion, my dear
nephews, at finding that I had been guilty of so
intolerable a fault. I blushed with confusion; I
most heartily thanked the old gentleman, not for
his integrity (which it would have been insulting
to mention to one of his great wealth) but for the
pains he had taken to seek out a careless young
man and to prevent his suffering loss.</p>

<p>“‘Nay,’ said that aged gentleman to me with a
low and pleasant laugh, ‘you must not thank me.
Perhaps had I myself come upon the treasure I
might have thought it too insignificant to restore.
But you must know that I am the Chief Magistrate
of this city and that last evening my officer noticed
from some distance a young man, apparently a
stranger to this city, whom he describes as of your
height and features, rise from the prayer-stone,
but leave behind him some object which, in the
gathering dusk, he could not distinguish. On his
approach he found it was this purse of yours
which some boys had already found and were quarrelling
over, when he took it from them. He
brought it to me with some description of your
person: I thought you might well be at this caravanserai
and brought it with me: I had the
pleasure of hearing my officer, who now accompanies
me, recognize you as we approached.’ That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
functionary bowed to me and I to him most ceremoniously,
and as I did so I was rapidly revolving
in my head what I had better do if the real owner
should appear. I was torn between two plans:
whether to denounce him as a thief before he
could speak, or to run off at top speed.</p>

<p>“This preoccupation I dismissed lest the anxiety
of it should appear upon my face.</p>

<p>“I again thanked this good old man most
warmly and we entered into a familiar conversation.
What was my delight at the close of it when
he bade me without ceremony accept of his hospitality
and come home to take a meal with him in
his palace. I was eager for further adventures,
and accompanied him with the greatest joy.</p>

<p>“Reclining at table, where there was served (as
I need hardly inform my dear nephews) lamb
stuffed with pistachio nuts, the old man asked me
whence I had come, what was my trade, and
whither I was proceeding.</p>

<p>“I answered (as I thought, prudently) that I
had come from Aleppo, that I had been entrusted
by my father with the sum in the purse he had so
kindly restored to me, in order to purchase pearls,
and that when the purchase was completed I had
instructions to sell them in India in a market
where my father was assured that pearls were
rare and fetched the highest prices.</p>

<p>“‘This is indeed well found!’ exclaimed the old
man, with enthusiasm. ‘I am myself seeking for
some one to whom I may sell a magnificent collection
of pearls inherited from my great-grandmother,
an Indian Begum. The old woman,’ he
added nonchalantly enough, ‘was a miser; she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
kept the drops higgledy-piggledy in an old cedarwood
box, and I confess myself quite ignorant of
their value. Moreover, as I have taken a liking to
you, I shall let you fix your own price, for I should
much like to remember when my time comes that
I had helped a friendless man in his first step to
fortune; only, I am a little ashamed to appear
to be making money out of an heirloom!’</p>

<p>“While the old gentleman so spoke I was
rapidly revolving in my mind what motive he
could have for such an affection of indifference to
wealth, when I recollected that he was the Chief
Magistrate of the city, and immediately concluded
that these pearls, being the property of local people,
and obtained by him for nothing by way of
bribes and other legal channels, he would both
desire to have them sold at a distance and would
let them go cheap.</p>

<p>“‘Nay,’ continued he, seeing that I hesitated as
these thoughts occurred to me, ‘I will take no
denial. For me it is but a mere riddance, and
for you a most excellent bargain. Come, I trust
your honest face and youthful candour. You shall
take them at your own price! And I will even
advise you of the city of India where you will find
your best market.’</p>

<p>“Put thus, the offer, I will confess, attracted
me; but I had already learned the wickedness of
mankind (though not as yet, I am glad to say, my
dear nephews, at my own expense), and I said
that I would at least so far meet him as to take
the jewels to a local merchant, invent some tale,
as though they were my own, and see what sum
might be offered for them. Only when I thus had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
some measure of their value could I honourably
make an offer. I continued at some length in this
strain, expressing a humble inability to judge, and
the fear lest my capital might not be sufficient
(which he pooh-poohed). I stipulated, for a reason
you will soon perceive, that a slave of his
should accompany me—if only as a matter of
routine—for (said I) I was very jealous of my
honour. He agreed, though he was good enough
to call it a pure formality.</p>

<p>“I left the aged magistrate with many thanks
and, accompanied by the slave, proceeded with the
pearls to the jewel merchants’ quarter in the
Bazaar. I stopped before one of the richest and
most reputed booths, and spreading the pearls before
the merchant told him that I was compelled
to sell these under order from authority as the
end of a family dispute, to pay the dowry of my
sister; that I therefore was in haste to settle and
would take the least price he might choose to mention
within reason. I was, said I, wholly in his
hands. It was urgent for me that the bargain
should be quickly completed, but before I could receive
his cash I must hear the lowest figure he
would name.</p>

<p>“While I thus spoke the slave stood respectfully
behind me and listened to our conversation.
The jewel merchant said that no class of merchandise
was more distasteful to him than pearls;
there was at this moment no market for them. It
was impossible to purchase them save properly set
and in regular sizes; and finally it was well known
that pearls were the most unlucky of gems. It was
quite impossible for him to offer more than 10,000<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
dinars, and even so he would doubtless be the loser
by the transaction.</p>

<p>“When I heard this I rapidly wrote upon a slip
of paper the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“‘<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,—The
chief merchant in this city
estimates your jewels at 10,000 dinars. I cannot,
alas, provide that sum, and therefore I cannot
honestly make an offer myself as I had hoped; if
you desire to have them sold here I will faithfully
execute your commission, but if you prefer that I
should return them to you send me word. Meanwhile,
I will still bargain here awaiting your
reply.’</p>
</div>

<p>“I sent this note by the slave and begged him to
give it to his master and to bring me an answer.
The slave went off, and when I judged him to be
well out of hearing I turned and said to the merchant,
sighing: ‘Well, since you offer no more I
must take what you offer; the slave whom you
saw me despatch carried the news to my family;
I burn when I think of how their scorn will mock
my humiliation. I therefore said nothing true of
the price. Indeed, I have set it down in that note
as something much higher. But I submit, for, as I
told you, I am pressed. Come, count me the
money, and I will away.’</p>

<p>“The merchant, after I had handed over the
pearls, counted me the money into yet another
large leathern bag, which I shouldered, and with
rapid steps bore out of the Bazaar and soon out of
the town itself, by a gate called the Bab-el-Jaffur,
that is, the gate of innocence.</p>

<p>“Beyond the town walls was a long roll of dusty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
sloping land set here and there with dusty stunted
bushes and having beyond it a high range of desert
hills. A track led roughly rising across it, away
from the town.</p>

<p>“I followed this track for one hour and then sat
down (for my new fortune was heavy) and rested.</p>

<p>“As I thought it probable that my good old
friend himself would return speedily with his
slave to the Bazaar, and as the complication of the
affair might embroil me, I hid during the remainder
of the day squeezed in a jackal’s earth beneath
a bank. Before nightfall I ventured out and gazed
about me, leaving my original pouch, my windfall
and my big leathern bag of 10,000 dinars in the
jackal’s earth while I surveyed the track.</p>

<p>“It was the hour I love above all others.</p>

<p>“The sun had just set beyond the distant ocean
towards which my face was turned, and between
me and which, upon the plain below—for I had
come to the rise of the mountain side—lay the
beautiful city I had just left. The fragrant smoke
of cedarwood rose from some of its roofs as the
evening fell. There was still hanging in the air
the coloured dust of evening above the roads of
entry, and there came faintly through the distance
the cry of the Muezzin.</p>

<p>“I was not so entranced by the natural beauty
of the scene as to neglect the duty which this
sound recalled. I fell immediately upon my knees
and was careful to add to the accustomed prayers
of that hour my heart-felt thanks for the Guidance
and the Grace which had so singularly increased
my fortunes in the last few hours.</p>

<p>“As I rose from these devotions I heard upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
my right a low wailing sound and was astonished
to discover there, seated hopelessly beneath a
small shrub and waving his hands in grief, a young
man of much my own height and appearance: but
I flatter myself that not even in my most careful
assumptions of innocence have I ever worn such a
booby face.</p>

<p>“He was swaying slowly from side to side, and
as he did so moaning a ceaseless plaint, the words
of which I caught and which touched me to the
heart. Over and over again he recited his irreparable
loss. He had but that small sum! It was
his patrimony! His sole security! How should
he answer for it? who should now support him?
or what should he do?</p>

<p>“So he wailed to himself in miserable monotone
till I could bear it no longer, for I saw that I had
by a singular coincidence come upon that poor
young man whose pouch I had been given in error
by the magistrate of the city.</p>

<p>“I bowed before him. He noticed me listlessly
enough and asked me what I would. I told him I
thought I could give him comfort. Was it not he,
said I, who had left a certain pouch (I carefully
described it) containing sundry coins upon a
prayer-stone outside the city at this very same
sunset hour of the day before? His despair was
succeeded by a startling eagerness. He leapt to
his feet, seized my arm, rose feverishly and implored
me to tell him further.</p>

<p>“‘Alas,’ I said, ‘what I have to tell you is but
little! I fear to raise your hopes too high—but at
any rate I can put you upon the track of your
property.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Sir,’ said he, resuming his hopeless tone for
a moment, ‘I have already done my best. I went
to the Chief Magistrate of the city to claim it and
was met by an officer of his who told me that the
purse had already been delivered to its owner, suspected
my claim and bade me return. But how
shall I prove that it is mine, or how, indeed, receive
it, since the abominable thief who took possession
of it must by now be already far away?’</p>

<p>“‘You do him an injustice,’ said I. ‘It is precisely
of him whom you uncharitably call a thief
that I would speak to you. You think that he is
far away, whereas he is really at your hand whenever
you choose to act, for this is the message
that I bring you. He awaits you even now, and
if you will present yourself to him he will restore
your property.’</p>

<p>“‘How can you know this?’ said the young man,
gazing at me doubtfully. ‘By what coincidence
have you any knowledge of the affair?’</p>

<p>“‘It is simple enough,’ said I. ‘This person to
whom your purse was given, and I, were in the
same inn. We fell to talking of our adventures
along the road, for he also was a stranger, and
he told me the singular tale how he had recovered
from the authorities a purse which he honestly
thought his own, for it was very like one
which he himself possessed; but that on finding
his own purse later on in his wallet he was overwhelmed
with regret at the thought of the loss he
had occasioned; at the same time he made me his
confidant, telling me that he intended to restore it
this very evening at sunset to the authorities and
that any one claiming it after that hour and prov<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>ing
it was his could recover it at the public offices.
But he warned me of one thing: the officers (he
told me) were convinced (from what indication I
know not, perhaps from the presence of something
in the purse, or perhaps from something they had
heard) that the owner dealt in <i>pearls</i>.’</p>

<p>“Here the young man interrupted me, and assured
me he had never bought or sold pearls in
his life, nor thought of doing so.</p>

<p>“I answered that no doubt this was so. But
that when the authorities had a whim it was well
to humour them. He would therefore do well to
approach the officer who guarded the gate of the
Chief Magistrate’s house, with the simple words,
‘I am the Seller of Pearls,’ on hearing which his
path would be made smooth for him, and he would
receive his belongings.</p>

<p>“The young man thanked me heartily; he even
warmly embraced me for the good news I had
given him, and felt, I fear, that his purse and his
small fortune were already restored to him. It
was a gallant sight to see him in the last of the
light swinging down the mountain side with a new
life in him, and I sincerely regretted from my
heart the necessity under which I was to imperil
his liberty and life. But you will agree with me,
my dear nephews, that I could not possibly afford
to have him at large.</p>

<p>“When he had gone and when it was fully night,
there being no moon and only the stars in the
warm dark sky, I rapidly took my burdens from
their hiding-place and proceeded, though with
some difficulty, up the mountain side, staggering
under such a weight, and deviating from the track<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
so that there should be less chance of finding myself
interrupted.</p>

<p>“I slept for a few hours. I awoke at dawn. I
counted my total fortune, and found that it was
just about 12,000 dinars, the most of it in silver.</p>

<p>“Carefully concealing it again, I left its hiding-place
and glided round the mountain until I came
to a place where a new track began to appear,
which led to a neighbouring village. Here I bought
an ass, and returning with it to my hiding-place
and setting my treasure upon it I went off at random
to spend the day in travelling as rapidly as I
might away from the neighbourhood by the most
deserted regions.</p>

<p>“I came, a little before sunset, upon a hermit’s
cave, where I was hospitably entertained and the
tenant of which refused all reward, asking me only
to pray for him, as he was certain that the prayers
of youth and innocence would merit him a high
place in Heaven.</p>

<p>“With this holy man I remained for some four
or five days, passing my time at leisure in his
retreat among the mountains, and feeding my donkey
upon the dried grasses which I brought in by
armfuls at dusk from the woodlands. Upon the
fifth day of this concealment the hermit came in
pensive and sad, and said to me:</p>

<p>“‘My son, with every day the wickedness of this
world increases, and the judgment of God will
surely fall upon it in a devastating fire! I have
but just heard that the Chief Magistrate of our
capital city, using as a dupe an innocent stranger,
sold to one of the great jewellers of the place for
no less than 10,000 dinars a quantity of pearls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
every one of which now turns out to be false and
valueless! Nay, I am told that the largest are
made of nothing but wax! And, what is worse,
not content with this first wickedness, the magistrate
under the plea that the young stranger had
disappeared confiscated the gems again and had
the poor merchant most severely beaten! But—worse
and worse! the poor youth having innocently
returned that very night to the city, was
seized by the guard and beheaded. Ya, ya,’ said
the good old man, throwing up his hands, ‘the
days increase, and their evil increases with
them!’”</p>

<p>At this moment the hoarse and discordant voice
of the Public Crier croaked its first note from the
neighbouring turret, and the nephews, who had sat
enraptured at their uncle’s tale, knew that it was
time to disperse. The eldest brother therefore
said:</p>

<p>“O uncle; before we go let me express the
thanks of all of us for your enrapturing story.
But let me also express our bewilderment at the
absence of all plan in your singular adventures.
For though we have listened minutely to all you
have said, we cannot discover what art you
showed in the achievement of any purpose. For
instance, how could you know that the pearls were
false?”</p>

<p>“I did not know it, my dear nephew,” replied
the great Merchant with beautiful simplicity, “and
the whole was the Mercy of Allah!... But come,
the hour of prayer is announced, and we must, following
the invariable custom of the Faithful, make
yet another joint in my singular tale. Come,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
therefore, on this day week, shortly after the last
of the public executions of the vulgar, and I will
tell you of my further fortunes: for you must
understand that the 12,000 dinars of which my
story now leaves me possessed are”—and here the
honest old man yawned again and waved his
hand—“but a flea-bite to a man like me.”</p>

<p>His seven little nephews bowed repeatedly, and,
walking backwards without a trip, disappeared
through the costly tapestries of their uncle’s
apartments.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER III<br />
  <small>ENTITLED <i>AL-TAWAJIN</i>, OR THE PIPKINS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">On</span>
the appointed day of the next week, when,
with the hour of public executions, the noon-day
amusements of the city come to an end, and
the citizens betake themselves to the early afternoon’s
repose, the seven boys were once more
seated in the presence of their uncle, whom they
discovered in a radiant humour.</p>

<p>He welcomed them so warmly that they imagined
for a moment he might be upon the point of offering
them sherbet, sweetmeats, or even money; they
were undeceived, however, when the excellent but
extremely wealthy old man, drawing his purse
lovingly through his fingers, ordered to have
poured out for each of them by a slave a further
draught of delicious cold water, put himself at his
ease for a long story, and resumed his tale:</p>

<p>“You will remember, my delightful nephews,”
he said, “how I found myself in the hermit’s hut
without a friend in the world, and with a capital
of no more than twelve thousand dinars which I
had carried thither in a sack upon donkey-back.
Indeed, it was entirely due to the Mercy of Allah
that my small capital was even as large as it was:
for had the merchant in the bazaar discovered the
pearls to be false he would not only have offered
me far less but might possibly, after having disposed
of the pearls, have given me over to the
police. As it was, Heaven had been kind to me,
though not bountiful, and I still had to bethink<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
me what to do next if I desired to increase my
little treasure.</p>

<p>“Taking leave, therefore, of the good hermit, I
pressed into his hand a small brass coin the
superscription of which was unknown to me and
which I therefore feared I might have some difficulty
in passing. I assured my kind host that it
was a coin of the second Caliph Omar and of value
very far superior to any modern gold piece of a
similar size. As the hermit, like many other
saintly men, was ignorant of letters, his gratitude
knew no bounds. He dismissed me with a blessing
so long and complicated that I cannot but
ascribe to it some part of the good fortune which
next befell me.</p>

<p>“For you must know that when, after laying in
stores at a neighbouring village, I had driven my
donkey forward for nearly a week over barren and
uninhabited mountains, and when I had nearly exhausted
my provision of dried cakes and wine (a
beverage which our religion allows us to consume
when no one is by), I was delighted to come upon
a fertile valley entirely closed in by high, precipitous
cliffs save at one issue, where a rough track
led from this enchanted region to the outer world.
In this valley I discovered, to my astonishment,
manners to be so primitive or intelligence so low
that the whole art of money-dealing was ignored
by the inhabitants and by the very Governors
themselves.</p>

<p>“The King (who, I am glad to say, was of the
Faithful) had, indeed, promulgated laws against
certain forms of fraud which he imagined to be
denounced in the Koran; but these were of so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
infantile a character that a man of judgment could
very easily avoid them in any plans he might
frame for the people’s betterment and his own.
The population consisted entirely of soldiers and
rustics, among all of whom not one could be discovered
capable of calculating with justice a compound
interest for ten years.</p>

<p>“Under these circumstances my only difficulty
lay in choosing what form my first enterprise
should take. After a little thought I decided that
what we call in Bagdad an Amalgamation of Competing
Interests would be no bad beginning.</p>

<p>“I began with due caution by investing a couple
of thousand dinars in the merchandise of a potter
who had recently died and whose widow needed
ready cash to satisfy the sacred demands of the
dead. She spent the money in the ornamentation
of his tomb, with which unproductive expenditure
the foolish woman was in no small degree concerned.”</p>

<p>Here the eldest of the nephews interrupted
Mahmoud to ask, most respectfully, why with a
capital of twelve thousand dinars he had used but
two, and why he had begun his experiment upon
the petty business of a poor widow.</p>

<p>“My son,” said his uncle affectionately, “you
do well to ask these questions. They show a reasoned
interest in the great art of Getting. Well
then, as to the smallness of my beginning, it was,
I hope, due to humility. For ostentation is hateful.
But a good deed is never thrown away—and
how useful I found this reserve of ten thousand
dinars (which I had in my meekness kept aside)
you shall soon learn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>“As to why I began operations in the kiln of
this poor widow, it was because I have ever loved
the little ones of this world and aided them to my
best endeavour. This charitable action also turned
out to be wise, as such actions often do; for I
could thus proceed at first unnoticed and begin
my new adventures without exciting any embarrassing
attention.</p>

<p>“I continued to live in the same small hut I had
hired on my arrival, under the floor of which I
kept my modest capital; and I put it about, as
modesty demanded, that I was almost destitute.</p>

<p>“As it was indifferent to me for the moment
whether I obtained a return upon this paltry investment
or no, I was able to sell my wares at very
much the same sum as they had cost me, and as I
had bought the whole stock cheap, that sum was
less than the cost of manufacture. There was a
considerable store of pipkins in the old sheds, and
while I sold them off at charitable rates (very
disconcerting to other merchants), I had time to
consider my next step.</p>

<p>“Upon this next step I soon determined. When,
with due delay, my original stock of pipkins had
been sold, I purchased a small consignment of
clay, I relit the fires in the kiln, I hired a couple
of starving potters, and I began to manufacture.</p>

<p>“The fame of my very cheap pipkins had
spread, as was but natural, and secured me an
increasing number of customers for my newly
made wares. But I thought it wrong to debauch
the peasants by selling them their pots under cost
price any longer. I was constrained by the plainest
rule of duty to raise my prices to the cost of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
manufacture—though no more, keeping Justice as
my guiding star. For, depend upon it, my dear
nephews, in business as in every other walk of
life an exact rectitude alone can lead us to the
most dazzling rewards.</p>

<p>“This price of mine was still lower than that of
all the other pipkin-makers, who had been accustomed
from immemorial time to the base idea of
profit, and were in a perpetual surmise what secret
powers I had to permit me such quotations. But
I made no mystery of the affair. I allowed all my
friends to visit my simple factory and I explained
to their satisfaction how organization and a close
attention to costings were sufficient to account for
my prosperity.</p>

<p>“Still, as my sales continued to grow, new
doubts arose, and with them, I am glad to say,
new respect for my skill in affairs.</p>

<p>“The simple folk wondered by what art I had
contrived so difficult a financial operation, but as
it was traditional among them that one who sold
goods cheap was a benefactor to the community,
my action was lauded, my fame spread, and the
number of my customers continually increased.</p>

<p>“You will not be slow to perceive, my dear boys,
that my competitors in the bazaar, being compelled,
to compete with my ruinous prices, were all
embarrassed, and that the less attentive or privileged
soon began to fall into financial difficulties,
the first of course being those who were the most
renowned among these simpletons for their cunning,
their silence, their lying, and their commercial
skill in general. These, as they were perpetually
trying new combinations to discover or to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
defeat my supposed schemes, were an easy prey.
Even the straightforward fellows who knew of no
art more subtle than the charging of ten per cent.
above cost price, and who did not play into my
hands by any wearisome financial strategy, began
to be roped into my net as the area of my operations
spread. For when I had acquired, at a calculated
loss, a good half of the pottery business
in this sequestered paradise, I could, by what is
known as the Fluctuation of the Market (but I
will not confuse you with technical terms), put my
remaining competitors into alternate fevers of
panic and expectation very destructive to a Sound
Business Judgment.</p>

<p>“Upon one day I would declare that a large consignment
of pottery being about to reach me, I
could sell pipkins at half the usual price. Pipkins
fell heavily, and I bought through my agent every
pipkin I could lay hold of. The supposed consignment,
I would then put about, had been broken to
atoms by an avalanche which had overwhelmed the
caravan at the very boundaries of the State.
Price leapt upward, and as I was the author of the
rumour I was also the first to take advantage of
the rise in price. But the very moment, my dear
nephews, that my sluggish competitors attempted
to follow suit the market would, oddly enough,
fluctuate again in a <i>downward</i> direction.</p>

<p>“Upon a certain morning when one Abdullah
(who was my boon companion and the next merchant
in importance to myself) decided to mark
his best pipkins at ten dinars the dozen I happened
most prudently to have offered my own at
eight and a half dinars to my favourite customers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>“And all this while I lived upon my hidden
hoard.</p>

<p>“Poor Abdullah came to me in a sweat, very
early the next morning, and after some meaningless
compliments and many pauses, asked me to
go into partnership. ‘For’ (said he) ‘though he
admitted he had not my capacities, yet he had a
long experience in the trade, a large connection
and many influential friends in the allied lines of
Pipkin brokerage, Pipkin insurance, Pipkin discount,
Pipkin remainders, and—a most important
branch—the buying and selling of Imaginary
Pipkins.’</p>

<p>“He could—he anxiously assured me—be of
great service as an ally, but he was free to confess
that if he continued as he was he would be
ruined; for, to tell the truth, he had already come
to the end of his resources and had not a dinar
in the house.</p>

<p>“I heard him out with a grave and sympathetic
countenance, heaving deep sighs when he touched
upon his fears, nodding and smiling when he spoke
of his advantages, patting him affectionately when
he professed his devotion to myself, and assuming
a look of anguish when he spoke of his approaching
ruin.</p>

<p>“But when he had concluded—almost in tears—I
told him in tones somewhat slower and graver
than my ordinary, that I had one fixed principle
in life, bequeathed me by my dear father, now in
Paradise, <i>never to enter into partnership</i>; no, not
with my nearest and dearest, but ever to remain
alone in my transactions. I frankly admitted that
this made me a poor man and would keep me poor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
It would be greatly to my advantage, in the despicable
goods of this world, to have at my disposal
Abdullah’s marvellous experience, his great array
of family and business connections (to which my
wretched birth could make no claim), and above all
his genius for following the market. But the
goods of this world were perishable—especially
earthenware—and the sacred pledge given to my
sainted parent counted more with me than all the
baked mud in the world.</p>

<p>“As I thus spoke Abdullah’s breast heaved with
tempestuous sobs, provoked by the affecting example
of my filial piety, but also, I fear, by the black
prospect of his own future.</p>

<p>“I could not bear to witness his distress. I
hastened to relieve it. Though my vow (I said)
forbade me solemnly to enter into partnership, yet
I could be of service to him in another manner. I
would lend him money at a low rate of interest
to the value of half his stock upon the security of
the whole. Times would change. The present
ruinous price of pipkins (by which I myself suffered
severely) could not long endure. He would
lift his head again and could repay me at his
leisure.</p>

<p>“He thanked me profusely, kissed my hand
again and again, and gave me an appointment
next day to view his merchandise and draw up
the contract.</p>

<p>“I visited him at the hour agreed. The public
notaries drew up an inventory of his whole stock,
including his house and furniture, his prayer
beads (which I was interested in, for they were of
a costly Persian make), his dead wife’s jewels,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
all his clothes, his bed, and his pet cat—an animal
of no recorded pedigree but reputed to be of the
pure Kashmir breed. I carefully noted all flaws,
however slight, in each pipkin of his warehouse
and set all such damaged goods aside as a makeweight.
The sound pipkins I made no bones of
but accepted frankly at their market value, and
when the whole was added up the valuation came
to no less than 20,000 dinars. Yet so hide-bound
in routine were the inhabitants of the place that
Abdullah—if you will believe me!—had actually
set his business stock down in his old books at
four-fold that amount!</p>

<p>“As I had had to carry on, I had not now left by
me my full hoard of 10,000 dinars. I had but 8,000
left. Yet I was in no difficulty. Half 20,000 is
10,000—but there would be deductions!</p>

<p>“The costs of all this inventory and mortgage
were, of course, set down against my valued
friend Abdullah, but since he had not the ready
cash wherewith to pay the notaries, their clerks,
the demurrage fees, the stamps, the royal licence,
the enregistration, the triplicates, the broker’s
commission, the ...”</p>

<p>“Pray, uncle,” cried the youngest of the
nephews, “what are all these?”</p>

<p>“You must not interrupt me, my boy,” answered
the great merchant, a little testily, “they
are the necessary accompaniments of such transactions....
Well, as I was saying, the broker’s
commission, the porter’s wages, the gratuities to
the notaries’ servants, the cleaning up of the warehouse
after all was over, and a hundred other
petty items, I generously allowed them to be de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>ducted
from the loan; for our Prophet has said,
‘<i>Blessed is he that shall grant delay to his debtor.</i>’
That very evening, with every phrase of goodwill
and expressed hopes for his speedy recovery of
fortune, I counted out to my dear friend Abdullah
the full balance of 16,325 dinars and one half dinar,
and left him overjoyed at the possession of so
much immediate wealth.</p>

<p>“But, alas! no man can forecast the morrow,
and all things were written at the beginning to be
as they shall be. So far from pipkins rising, the
price fell slowly and regularly for three months,
during which time I was careful to restrict my
own production somewhat, though my poor dear
friend, in his necessity, produced more feverishly
than ever, and thereby did but lower still further
the now really infamous price of pipkins.</p>

<p>“At last he came to a dead stop, and could produce
no more. I gladly allowed the first, the second
and even the third arrears of interest to be
added to the principal at a most moderate compound
rate, but there was some fatality upon him,
and I was inexpressibly shocked to hear one
morning that Abdullah had drowned himself over
night in a beautiful little lake which his long dead
wife had designed for him in his once charming
pleasure grounds.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Poor man!” cried all the nephews in
chorus.</p>

<p>“Poor man! Poor man indeed!” echoed their
benevolent uncle, “I was a stranger in that country.
He was the closest tie I had to it, and, indeed,
in my loneliness, the nearest companion I had in
the whole world.” And here the good old man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
paused to breathe a prayer for the departed companion
of his long-past youth. He then sighed
deeply and continued:</p>

<p>“I used what had now become my considerable
influence with the government to provide him a
costly funeral at the public expense—for he had
left no effects, nor even children to follow him. I
walked behind the coffin as chief mourner, and
though I attempted to control my grief, all the
vast crowd assembled were moved by my manly
sorrow, and several spoke to me upon it at the
conclusion of the sad rites.</p>

<p>“I allowed the decent interval of three days to
elapse and then did what I had no choice but to
do. I took over Abdullah’s factory on foreclosure
and added it to my own.</p>

<p>“In this way the valuable kilns and stores
of clay and wheels and vehicles, etc., all became
my property. I had them valued, and was pleasurably
surprised to discover that they were worth
at least 25,000 dinars.</p>

<p>“A full two years had now passed since my first
coming to this happy and secluded valley where
Allah had poured out upon me His blessings in so
marvellous a fashion. I was lonely, as you may
imagine, but I manfully faced my duty. I continued
to supervise and extend my manufactory of
pipkins which now provided these articles for
more than half the households of the State. I
therefore could and did put the price of these useful
articles upon a basis which, if it was somewhat
higher than that to which people had grown accustomed
during my earlier manipulations, had the
priceless advantage of security, so that the house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>wife
could always know exactly what she had to
disburse—and I what I should receive. As I
manufactured upon so large a scale my overhead
charges....”</p>

<p>“What are overhead ...” began the eldest
nephew, when his uncle, visibly perturbed, shouted
“Silence!... You have made me forget what I
was going to say!”</p>

<p>There was an awkward pause, during which the
old man restored his ruffled temper and proceeded:</p>

<p>“I was able to buy clay more cheaply and better
than the private pipkin-makers (for so they were
now called, with well merited contempt) who still
vainly attempted to compete with me, and my business
automatically grew as the poor remnant of
theirs declined.</p>

<p>“Not only did I continually increase in wealth
by these somewhat obvious methods, but also in
the power of controlling property; for when some
fresh fool among my fellow pipkin-makers found
himself in difficulties, it was my practice to seek
him secretly, to condole with him upon what I had
heard was his approaching misfortune, and to
save him from ruin by taking over the whole of his
stock. Nay! I would do more. I would rescue
him from the sad necessity of attempting some
new unknown trade by taking him into my own
employment at a generous salary (but upon a
monthly agreement); with a pretty concession to
sentiment I would even leave him to manage his
own dear old booth in the bazaar to which so many
years had now accustomed him. I look back with
pleasure upon the tears of gratitude which stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
in the eyes of those to whom I extended such
favours.</p>

<p>“So things went on for one more year, and another,
and another, till the fifth year of my sojourn
among these simple people was completed.</p>

<p>“I was in complete control of the pipkin trade,
making all the pipkins that the nation needed, and
free from any rival. The house which I had built
for myself was the finest in the place, but covered,
I humbly add, with many a sacred text. Above its
vast horseshoe gate, ablaze with azure tiles, was
inscribed in gold the sentence, ‘Wealth is of God
alone.’</p>

<p>“I was popularly known as ‘Melek-al-Tawajin,’
or the Pipkin King, but officially decorated with
the local title of ‘Warzan Dahur,’ which was the
highest they knew and signifies ‘Leader in battle.’
I was entitled to wear a sword with a silver hilt
in a jewelled scabbard, an ornament of which I
was justly proud, but the blade of which I very
sensibly kept blunt lest my servant should cut himself
when he polished it, or even I should inadvertently
do myself a mischief when I pulled it out
with a flourish to display it to my guests, or
saluted with it on parade. I had become a most
intimate companion of the Court and was the most
trusted counsellor of the King, to whose wives also
I often lent small sums of money; nor did I ask
to be repaid.</p>

<p>“In such a situation I mused upon my condition,
and felt within me strange promptings for a
new and larger life. I was now well advanced in
manhood, I was filled with desires for action and
device which the narrow field of that happy but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
restricted place could not fulfil. I longed for adventurous
action in a larger world.</p>

<p>“The output and consumption of pipkins was at
an exact unchangeable level; the revenue a fixed
amount. The profit of the trade I held came to
some 20,000 dinars in the year, the full purchase
of which should be, say, 200,000 dinars.</p>

<p>“I prayed earnestly for guidance, and one night
as I so prayed an idea was revealed to me by the
Most High.</p>

<p>“I approached the King and told him how, all
my life, I had nourished the secret belief that a
trade necessary to the whole community should
not, in justice, be controlled by a private individual,
but should rather be the full property of
the State, of which His Majesty was the sole
guardian.</p>

<p>“The King listened to me with rapt attention as
I unfolded with an inspired eloquence my faith
that no one man should intercept profits which
were due to the work of all. ‘It is your majesty,’
I cried, ‘who alone should have control over what
concerns the body corporate of your people.’ He
and he alone should superintend the purchase of
pipkins, should regulate their sales, should receive
all sums paid for them, and should use that
revenue as he might think best for himself and
the commonwealth. ‘While I was struggling in
the dust and confusion of commercial life,’ I concluded,
‘I had no leisure to work out my scheme
in its entirety, nor even to appreciate its serene
equity—but now ... now, I see, I understand, I
know!’</p>

<p>“Carried away by the fire of my conviction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
my Royal Master could no longer brook delay.
He bade me put the idea in its main lines before
him at once, and assured me it should at once be
put into execution.</p>

<p>“I thereupon pulled out a paper showing that
since I was fully agreeable to take no more than
the cash value of the trade <i>plus</i> goodwill and <i>plus</i>
certain probable gains which I might reasonably
expect in the future, I would be amply compensated
if I were to hand all over to the Commonwealth
for the merely nominal sum of half a million
dinars—500,000. ‘A sum which,’ I continued,
‘is of little moment to your Majesty; especially as
it will be met by the taxation of your willing and
loyal subjects.’</p>

<p>“The matter was at once concluded. My great
act of renunciation was everywhere acclaimed
with transports of public joy. Every honour was
heaped upon me. The King himself pronounced
my panegyric at the farewell banquet given in my
honour, and an inscription was ordered to be encrusted
in the most gorgeous tiles on the chief
gate of the city: ‘On the tenth day of the month
Shaaban in the three hundred and third year from
the Flight of the Prophet, by the act of Mahmoud
the Magnificent all citizens became in the matter
of <span class="smcap">Pipkins</span> his common heirs.’”</p>

<p>The Merchant had been so moved by these old
memories that he had difficulty in proceeding.
He was silent for a few moments, and then ended
in a more subdued tone.</p>

<p>“The sum of 500,000 dinars, well packed, will
load without discomfort some dozen camels.
These and their drivers were provided me by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
grateful nation. I passed out of the town at sunrise,
attended by a vast concourse of the populace
who pressed round me in a delirium of grateful
cries, and so took my way eastward across the
mountains and left this happy vale forever.”</p>

<p>At that moment the detestable falsetto of the
Muezzin was heard from the neighbouring minaret,
and the boys, all dazed at the recital of such
triumphs, left the presence of their uncle as
though it had been that of a God.</p>

the hour of public executions had
arrived and the boys were assembled once
more at their uncle’s feet to hear the story of
his fortunes, (their minds full of his last success),
the old man, still occupied with that pleasing
memory, began at once the continuation of his
life.</p>

<p>“I left the valley, as I told you, my dear
nephews, nourished by the memory of a whole
people’s gratitude and giving thanks to God who
had made me the humble instrument of so great
a good. They err who think that great wealth
is marked with oppression, or that the rich man
has despoiled the populace. Upon the contrary,
the fortunes of the wealthy are but an index of
what excellent work they have done for all; and I,
for my part, equally joined in my heart the
memory of all the benefits I had conferred upon
my kind in the matter of Pipkins, and my overflowing
satisfaction at the heavy bags of coin
which swayed upon the backs of my camels.</p>

<p>“Day after day we proceeded, my caravan and
I, through the high hills, pitching our camp each
evening by some wooded torrent side and nourishing
ourselves with the provisions with which I had
amply stored my company at my departure.</p>

<p>“Such scenes were solemn and inclined the
mind to reverence. Never had my prayers been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
more sincere and deep than they were during the
long watches I passed in the cloudless nights of
those mountains, in the solemnity of their vast
woods; and the holy thoughts of grateful affluence
harmonized with the ceaseless voices of the forest.</p>

<p>“I had during this long journey through the
barrier range but little opportunity to exercise
those gifts in which I may humbly say I excel.
For these villages were few and poor and the
opportunities for talent were rare. It was indeed
my duty to keep my hand in, as the saying goes,
and not to let my wealth diminish as I passed.
Thus I would, for mere practice, strike some little
bargain from time to time. I would purchase
obsolete arms from some village less backward
than the rest and sell them at some further stage
onward to rude mountaineers who had not even
heard of such ancient weapons. I was not above
offering to carry, as my caravan passed, sundry
goods from one farm to another at an agreed
price, and these (after selecting what from among
them seemed to me best worth keeping) I would
punctually deliver to their consignees.</p>

<p>“I amused myself at my leisure, also, when I
was in no haste, with occasional experiments in
engineering such as suit the more educated man
among his fellows. Thus I would let the water
out from a dam as I passed it and then, at a considerable
price, repair the ravages the escaping
water might have made in the valley below. And
I was even agreeable to retrace my steps and
repair the damage which the flood had inevitably
occasioned to the barrier itself: charging a suitable
sum for both operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sometimes—when the occasion offered—I did
business on a somewhat larger scale. I remember
purchasing a whole train of wheat which was
on its way to one of the larger hamlets, and when
I arrived there keeping the people in some suspense
(but not to the point of actual famine)
until their necessity very naturally produced an
excellent price for the grain. I also negotiated
ransoms from time to time upon commission when
I found myself in a district of brigands—simple
folk—and I picked up some very curious carvings
and pieces of metal work at a price satisfying to
their rude owners yet promising an enormous
profit when I should reach the plains.</p>

<p>“But all these were mere jests and pastimes,
the occupation of enforced idleness as my long
journey through the hills continued. At last I
came to a place which had been described to me
by a trusty servant, where, from the height of a
pass I saw some thousands of feet below me the
foothills descending rapidly on to an even plain
which stretched, brown and sun-burned, to the
horizon. Not far from the base of the mountains,
at the edge of this plain, a noble river wandered
in many branches, separated by sandbanks; for
I had been seven weeks in the hills and it was now
the height of summer, the snows had long since
melted away on the heights, and the stream was
low.</p>

<p>“I pitched my last camp a mile or two from the
hither bank of this great river, and sent forward
certain of my servants to discover how best it
might be crossed. They returned the next morning
and told me that in several of its branches it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
was too deep to be forded, but at the place where
the shores seemed to approach each other (where
there was no interrupting islands, but one continuous
sea of water four furlongs wide), a ferry
had been established from a road-end and plied
regularly for the passage of merchants, pilgrims
and other travellers who there went over from
the hills to the Kingdom of the Plain upon the
further bank. I sent them back with an appointment
for the ferry to be prepared to take my
numerous caravan from the first hour after sunrise
on the morrow. We packed all our gear,
struck camp in the first dusk of dawn and duly
reached the ferry head where a large flat boat
manned with a dozen rowers captained by the
old ferryman of the place waited us on a sort
of wharf.</p>

<p>“The passage was tedious, and would take the
whole day; for the stream was swift and no more
than one camel could cross at a time.</p>

<p>“I was in some little hesitation how to act.
If I remained upon the hither bank until all had
passed over I could not be certain that my servants
who had gone ahead would not play me a
trick. If I crossed first I could not overlook the
doings of my servants who had yet to cross; and
though I had no reason to doubt their perfect
honesty, neither had I any reason to doubt their
vile thievish character. At last I made the following
plan: I discharged all the camels of their
packs, putting the packs on board in one heap,
being very careful to put on board all the food
as well as the coin. With this and one camel
which I attended myself and hobbled, I crossed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
alone. I then went back again with the ferryman
and his crew, still keeping my provisions and my
coin, and brought over another camel and his
driver, and so on until the whole of my company
was transferred. Not till all the camels and their
drivers were assembled, clamouring with hunger,
upon the further bank, did I allow the coin and
food to be landed under my very eye.</p>

<p>“The time which all this took made my retinue
ravenously hungry, as I have said, and as the day
wore on I was indeed touched by the earnest
prayers they made for a little food, but I was
too wise to yield, and it was not until the whole of
my company was gathered together on the further
bank, and I with it, that I permitted the cases to
be landed and gave them all a hearty meal.</p>

<p>“It was by that time near sunset. We pitched
our camp and waited till the morning to find a
more regular habitation, for I had noticed a very
little way off from the further bank, and somewhat
upstream, not a few scattered houses standing
in gardens and shaded in a grove of trees.</p>

<p>“I had as yet no plan how I might use the sums
of which I was possessed. I was rather waiting
for a venture to come to me than going out myself
to seek it, when a chance word from the old ferryman,
as I paid him the fares (which I had already
contracted for at a great reduction, seeing how
numerous we were), started me upon a train of
thought.</p>

<p>“And here, my nephews, I will beg you to
observe that any hint of opportunity must be
seized at once. It is thus that great things are
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>“What the ferryman said was, ‘A curse on
those who come so loaded’ (for he grumbled and
contended that his old crazy craft might have
sprung a leak under such a pressure of traffic).</p>

<p>“‘Yet,’ said I in reply, ‘you have no lack of
custom. As it is this day’s business has left many
disappointed, and I see upon the further bank the
fires of those who have been kept waiting the
whole day. They will be a hundred or more to
claim your services by morning.’</p>

<p>“‘That is true,’ he answered, ‘but luckily few
come as loaded as you or with so many beasts.
This is none the less a good place of traffic, for it
is the only passage across the water for many
miles up and down stream, and serves the main
road through the kingdom.’</p>

<p>“I asked him why had he not thought to meet
the pressure by purchasing larger boats, or
more of them, and hiring more men; since it was
clear there was profit in the place, and a greater
demand of travellers than he could accommodate.</p>

<p>“He answered again in the surly tone which
people use when they boast of changeless custom,
that the old boat had been good enough for his
father and had served him all his own life, and
was good enough for him. By this reply I saw
that he was without the funds for replacing his
old boat by more and better craft. This my discovery
was the beginning of all that followed.</p>

<p>“Before striking my camp the next day I first
put the old ferryman in a reasonable humour by
giving him good food and drink and treating him
honestly in my conversation. When I saw that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
was in a mood to be approached I suggested that
we should enter a kind of partnership.</p>

<p>“‘I am,’ said I, ‘quite at my leisure. I am
under no need to go forward until I choose. I
have thought of hiring some one of these habitations
which I see in yonder grove, and of making
a long sojourn here, for the perpetual spectacle of
all this traffic crossing and re-crossing a great
river under the mountains is a delight.’</p>

<p>“The old ferryman answered that he needed no
partner, that he earned all that he needed by his
trade and that he preferred to be alone. He also
said that my foreign face was distasteful to him,
and that grand people were often less trustworthy
than they seemed.</p>

<p>“‘Your sentiments,’ I answered, ‘are a proof
of your wisdom, and also do you honour. But
has it not occurred to you that if in the place of
this one old craft half a dozen good new boats,
much larger and properly manned, were provided,
more comers would be tempted to pass here,
there would be less delay, both the volume of
traffic and the pace would be increased? I cannot
but think it an excellent proposition.’</p>

<p>“I have found, my dear nephews, that obstinate
old men are easier to shepherd into financial
schemes than any other sort: nor was I here
disappointed.</p>

<p>“The old mule made the admission which all
such men make after the first conventional delays.
He said: ‘That is all very well, but who is to
pay for them?’</p>

<p>“I replied quietly that I would. ‘I shall be
delighted,’ said I, ‘to furnish half a dozen new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
boats and to pay for the men to row them until
the new turnover begins. All I ask is that you
shall still keep your present earnings, but share
with me in equal amounts the new and extra
earnings which my plan will almost certainly
produce.’</p>

<p>“It took me some time to rub into his rusty
head the terms of my very favourable proposal.
He kept on mixing up the division of any future
profits and the division of his present income.
Never did I appreciate more than during my
conversations with this stupid granfer the necessity
for patience in spreading a commercial
snare. I was at fearful pains to get the thing
into his obtuse brain. He <i>could</i> be no poorer,
for I asked nothing of his present earnings: he
<i>might</i> be much richer, for he would have half
any future additions. I would guarantee him the
income he was already earning on condition that
the much larger income to be earned by my
methods should, over and above that guaranteed
revenue of his, be equally divided between us.</p>

<p>“He still seemed to think that there was some
flaw or catch somewhere. He wanted the thing,
simple as it was, explained to him over and over
again. At last he got it clear; he got by heart
and repeated the refrain: ‘Cannot be poorer, may
be richer.’ Nor did it occur to him to wonder
why I was so oddly generous.</p>

<p>“I had our contract drawn up in due form,
witnessed and sealed. I then caused to be constructed
by the local shipwrights four first-class
flat boats, some ten <i>diram</i> long by five wide. I
saw to it that they should be painted in gay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
colours and in general have that vulgar violence
so attractive to the masses. On their completion
I added them to the existing capital of the ferry
line.</p>

<p>“At the same time I pointed out to him who
was now my partner something which that same
stupidity of his had made him miss, to wit, that
as he had a monopoly his charges were far too
low. ‘Moreover,’ said I, ‘when you consider
what fine new boats I have put into service and
how, as a consequence, the stream of traffic is
increasing, to neglect the opportunity of profit
is a great sin for which you will be answerable on
the Day of Resurrection. Why, it was but yesterday
that you passed over twice as many people,
you assured me, as ever you did in any other one
day in your life!’</p>

<p>“So wedded to custom was the old gentleman
that he still hesitated, but remembering how
right I had been in my innovation and unable to
contest the evidence of his own eyes how from
day to day the volume of traffic increased, he at
last somewhat reluctantly consented. The fares
were doubled, yet the applications of people
desiring to cross the river grew no less. There
arose a substantial profit, over and above the old
ferryman’s original income, to be divided between
us, and judged by the cost of the new boats
I was making some ten per cent. upon my money,
a very reasonable profit under the circumstances....”</p>

<p>Here Mahmoud the great merchant, paused,
shut his eyes for a few moments, and continued
in a murmur. “A very reasonable profit. Ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
per cent., a very reasonable profit.” Then, suddenly
opening his eyes fiercely, he fixed them
upon his alarmed nephews and cried.</p>

<p>“Was it not strange for a man of my temperament
to remain thus pottering with a few boats
and leaving sacks full of coin unused? You have
only heard the beginning of the scheme upon
which I was engaged!</p>

<p>“I had already purchased a very nice little
property with a convenient house upon it, standing
some yards back from the bank of the river
and perhaps one hundred yards above the ferry.</p>

<p>“I next purchased a field upon the further
bank, exactly opposite this house and its garden.
I amused myself sometimes by rowing across the
river from the steps at the foot of my ground to
the field which I had purchased upon the other
side. I sowed that field with beans of a particular
kind with which (so I assured my neighbours),
I was experimenting after an agricultural fashion.
They were much interested, for agriculture is
highly developed in that part, with the result that
the highest arts, especially those of finance, are
shamefully neglected.</p>

<p>“I allowed a few months to pass, during which
the use of the ferry under my improved methods
had more than trebled. It attracted to itself,
now that the passage was so much easier, forms
of traffic which it had hitherto not known. I even
added to the fleet one huge pontoon for the special
service of an elephant which we had warning was
to pass, and when this was known, those great
animals, which had previously used a ford several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
days upstream, were attracted to the shorter
mountain road by the ferry.</p>

<p>“When all this was so prosperously established,
I informed a few of the friends I had made
in the neighbourhood that I must indulge in the
fancy of a rich man and amuse myself by throwing
a bridge between my house and the field I
had bought upon the other shore. ‘It will save
me,’ said I, ‘the perpetual trouble of rowing across
in my little skiff and also occupy my leisure; for
I am something of an engineer.’</p>

<p>“In truth very little engineering was required.
All I had to do was to drive strong piles at intervals
into the stream, lay trestles upon them, stay
them with large baulks upon either side, and so
make a good working bridge. It was no more than
fit for foot traffic, but for this it was very convenient.</p>

<p>“Having now this communication I bought
more land upon the further bank and developed
there a very nice little model farm. I will not deny
that foot passengers would occasionally ask my
leave to cross by the bridge in order to save them
the tedious passage by water. These I always
refused lest it should prejudice the interests of
my friend the ferryman; I made an exception only
for one or two neighbours whom I desired to
favour, and occasionally for really important people
with whom the ferryman would not desire to
quarrel. But I have a good heart, and at last I
began to wink at the use of the bridge by more
than these. Children especially (for I am very
fond of young people) I could not bear to condemn
to the troublesome passage by ferry, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
gave orders to my people to allow their trespass.</p>

<p>“At last a regular path got established through
my farm, and whether from slackness or generosity
I know not, but I allowed the crossing of the
river by my bridge to increase in volume and to
become a daily practice. When it had reached a
certain volume my detestation of disorder compelled
me to make certain regulations. I put up
a gate at either end and charged a purely nominal
sum which went, as I pointed out, to the upkeep
of the bridge; though, of course, it did not nearly
meet that expenditure.</p>

<p>“To avoid the length and inconvenience of the
passage by water this toll was cheerfully paid,
and as the season advanced my bridge was more
and more used.</p>

<p>“My partner, the old ferryman, saw all this
with a confused eye. He had the sense to see
that I would not hurt my own investment by competition,
yet he could not but perceive that there
was here an increasing rivalry to his own long-established
route.</p>

<p>“At last he approached me and asked me if we
could not come to some pact; I said that I saw
no occasion for that. There was plenty of room
for both. I was a wealthy man, and an act of generosity
was a kind of luxury for me; I could
hardly ask people who had now grown used to so
easy a passage to go back to the monopoly of
the boats with their primitive, slow and clumsy
business of embarking and disembarking, and
their necessary delays and crowding. I pointed
out to my revered partner that the boats were
still necessary for all heavy merchandise and for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
animals, and I also pointed out very strongly to
the ferryman what he could not deny, that I
would hardly do anything to prejudice him since
that would be also to prejudice myself, as I was
his partner. I even ridiculed him for not perceiving
the force of such an argument before coming
to me, and for troubling me with what was
obviously nonsense.</p>

<p>“He still grumbled, however. He said that he
was no scholar, that it sounded all right, but that
he did not feel comfortable. I answered that I
could not help his feelings, but it was a plain
matter of common sense, and so dismissed him.</p>

<p>“I then announced my intention of strengthening
the bridge considerably and making it sufficient
to support any kind of traffic. And so I did,
at a very considerable expense. When I had completed
the task it was a fine structure which would
take every kind of beast of burden and vehicle,
and a constant stream of foot-passengers. The
only exception I made was for elephants, which
animal (I said) I might allow later, but not until
I had had the whole thing thoroughly tested.
These beasts, therefore, still had to use the ferry:
but as they were few in number and difficult to
handle they only increased my partner’s troubles.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the fame of my bridge spread
throughout all the neighbouring countries, it gathered
upon itself the whole volume of commerce.</p>

<p>“The old ferryman came to me in a mixed mood
of anger, panic and delirious complaint. He said
that his revenue was falling with alarming rapidity,
added (a little spitefully I thought) that my
share of that revenue would be not a quarter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
what it had been in the past year, and said very
plainly that if I did not make some change in my
regulations my own profit would disappear altogether:
that nothing would be left but his original
revenue and that even this was now in doubt.
As I answered nothing to all this long plea but
let him talk himself out he ended up by asking,
with some irony, whether I was one of those rich
fools who liked to throw away their money.</p>

<p>“Then it was that I answered him as he deserved
to be answered, for I do not easily brook
insult. I told him that I had mortgaged my share
in the enterprise of the boats sometime before to
a neighbour at a very good price before ever the
bridge had appeared, that I was sufficiently pestered
by this man who ascribed to me the continued
decline in the revenue which I received
and handed over to him, and that I would not have
added to this perpetual annoyance the further
complaint of my inept partner. I drove him from
my presence and told him I desired never to see
him again.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that if I had been approached
properly I would have made some sort of compensation
to the neighbour to whom I had mortgaged
at a fine figure my original share in the
profits of the ferry. I had enjoyed a large sum
which he could now never recover, and I might
have let him have a fifth or a quarter of it back,
merely as a piece of generosity. But when I
discovered that he had himself resold his interest
to an ignoramus who was at that moment trying
to find a purchaser for his rapidly shrinking property
I lost all patience with the combination of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
them and put every thought of the ferry out of
my mind. The new purchaser foreclosed on his
mortgage and got for the ferry one-third of what
he had lent on it.</p>

<p>“It was shortly after this transaction that the
old ferryman went mad. It began by his coming
to my house daily and making scenes outside the
doors. Then he took to breaking the windows, and
at last to gathering crowds and haranguing them
on his imaginary persecution at my hands. I was
compelled to have him locked up in his own defence,
and I am glad to say that a merciful fever
soon relieved him of what had become incurable
delusions. He did not recover his sanity, however,
as is so often the case, even in the last few
hours before death. He continued to call me the
most dreadful names, and to rave, in his mania
of persecution, shouting that he had been robbed
and ruined. It was a pitiful ending to what had
long been a useful if obscure life.</p>

<p>“As I could not bear to see the men whom he
had employed starve I took them into my own
employ for the making of a roadway to the bridge,
for the further strengthening of it, the painting
of it and so on, and sent all the ferry-boats down
the river where they would be of more use than
at this part where by my enterprise and public
spirit the bridge had come into existence. I purchased
them as old timber from the owners and
made an insignificant profit of some few thousand
dinars.</p>

<p>“It is a pretty example of the way in which
names cling to places that the point on the bank
where the ferry used to ply is still called ‘The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
Madman’s Grave.’ For, indeed, the old fellow
was buried, I heard, by his own request, close to
where his boat used to ply.</p>

<p>“It was now high time to consider the whole
question of the bridge and its finances. Through
my goodness of heart and generous carelessness—defects
or amiable frailties against which I have
always to be upon my guard—the whole thing had
got into a very unbusiness-like condition. The
tolls were not more than customary payments,
though I had raised them from time to time.
There was no careful distinction between the different
kinds of traffic. There were no regulations
for the hours at which the bridge should be used,
nor ready means of checking the accounts.</p>

<p>“The new Bridge had caused the town to increase
largely. Its governors and those of the
adjoining districts were rightly concerned in its
proper ordering.</p>

<p>“The authorities of the neighbourhood fully
agreed with me that it was necessary to put the
thing upon a more regular footing. I suggested
to them that before going further it would be but
a kindly and reasonable act to consult those who
made regular use of the bridge upon a large
scale, and especially the merchants of the place
and of the more distant towns upon the farther
bank who crossed and recrossed at stated intervals
and with considerable trains of traffic. These,
therefore, were courteously convened. They were
regarded as representing the mass of humbler
footfolk and between us all we drew up an excellent
arrangement.</p>

<p>“First we made ourselves into a Council. Next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
we voted ourselves full powers to do what we
liked in managing the Bridge.</p>

<p>“The merchants who were regular users of the
bridge and who passed and repassed with their
trains upon an average once a month, were to be
free of toll on condition that they should pay an
annual subscription to the upkeep of the structure.
It came to an average, for each of their beasts of
burden, to about one-quarter of the public toll,
and for each of their servants to less than one-half.</p>

<p>“The common folk of the town and the villages,
the herdsmen and all the humbler multitude
which used the bridge in less lucrative fashion
were to pay a toll double the original, which, after
all, was only fair when one considered that they
were compelled to use the bridge as there was
now no other passage across the stream. I should
add that the local authorities which sat with us
upon this Council, after drawing up the Ordinances,
passed a local By-law full of common sense
and the spirit of order. In this By-law they forbade
the use of any boats whatsoever for the
crossing of the water, under the excellent plea
that men had in the past occasionally been
drowned from these and that, anyhow, there was
now a good bridge and no necessity for this old-fashioned
and backward kind of travel.</p>

<p>“People were also forbidden to swim the river
between sunset and sunrise upon the grounds of
security and police control, and between sunrise
and sunset upon the grounds of decency.</p>

<p>“After the new regulations had been passed the
gates were strengthened, regular officers were appointed
to take the toll and I was public-spirited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
enough to permit my own servants to be withdrawn
and these officials to be named (and paid)
by the new Council, retaining to myself no more
than the right of receiving the tolls and taking on
of course the burden of upkeep as against the
sums which I received from the regular merchants.
I also reserved to myself the right, whenever the
Council or the local authorities thought it necessary
to have the bridge strengthened or repaired
or painted, or ornamented, or decorated upon
feast days, or covered with an awning during the
great heats, to take up the contract for all these
services at a price to be agreed upon between myself
and the Council and the local authorities, at
the head of whom was my dear old friend the
Sheik.</p>

<p>“When all these arrangements had been made,
the thing was on a proper basis and formed, I am
glad to say, for many other similar arrangements
a precedent, in which the advantages of the public
and a proper return on capital were both considered.
My ‘Bridge Council’ as it was called was
copied in many another enterprise in those parts,
to not a few of which I was admitted as a director.</p>

<p>“But one must march with the times. It could
not be denied that this conservative and established
way of recouping expenses and interest by
tolls, excellent in its time, no doubt, had its drawbacks.
There was something rather absurd in
these progressive days (such was the phrase used
to me by my friend the Sheik of the place—which
was now growing under the influence of my bridge
to be a very large town), there was something
rather absurd in the spectacle of gates put up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
block that very passage which had only been
erected for the convenience of the community!
What would not posterity think of us if they heard
that we built a bridge and then put up gates to
interfere with its constant and easy use? It was
a burden also upon the community that officials
should have to be employed at either end checking
payments, keeping books and all the rest of it.</p>

<p>“What was worse, there seemed to be some
leakage. Officials could not always be trusted to
make an exact return (for they were of the baser
sort at a small salary). It was suspected that
their relatives and friends had been allowed to
cross free of toll, for we could not keep a big
watch at night and there was I fear a good deal of
illicit use of the bridge.</p>

<p>“All of this, quite apart from the bad example
it gave and the feeling of disorder it created, was
also a source of anxiety to those who were concerned
with the finance of the enterprise. The
feeling grew rapidly—at least it grew very
strongly in me and I made every effort to spread
it in others—that Progress and sundry other virtues
with which the Plain prided itself (as against
the half-barbaric people of the mountains) demanded
that all these anomalies should cease, and
that the simple policy of ‘THE FREE BRIDGE’
should triumph.”</p>

<p>As the aged merchant described the last stage of
his adventure his face took on an animated look;
he spoke with decision; there was a freedom in
his gesture which recalled his old oratorical triumphs
when he had occasion as a younger man to
combine the practice of commerce, investment and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
finance with the public speeches which had rendered
him famous. He seemed, for the moment,
not so much the Merchant as the Senator, the
Free Bridgeite of the great old days, and his
nephews could not but admire the lofty air, the
direct glance, the eloquent vibration of voice which
accompanied this mood.</p>

<p>“I for my part,” continued the old gentleman,
now transformed by the recollection of his part
in public life, “did not fear to speak openly in
the Council and (such was my love for my fellow-citizens)
even in the market-place. I was untiring
in explaining the simple economic principles
underlying the policy of The Free Bridge. I was
delighted to observe, as my efforts proceeded, two
parties forming—the Free Bridgeites, who had
the tide with them and were in the spirit of their
day, and another party which, for lack of a better
name, I will call the Recalcitrants, who were but
a hotchpotch of evil-minded malcontents, dolts,
public enemies, and in general a body who had no
argument save that things were very well as they
were and it was a pity to change.</p>

<p>“I need scarcely tell you which of these competing
interests won. Intelligence, business enterprise,
public spirit, common sense, justice and
eighteen or nineteen other things which for the
moment escape me supported the glorious triumph
of The Free Bridge. At last, when the moment
was ripe for it to be voted upon, we swept our
opponents out of existence at the polls, securing
out of every 100 votes no less than fifty-three for
our project.</p>

<p>“The Sheik who, in the growing importance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the community was now confirmed in his office by
his Sovereign under the title of Excellent, delivered
an unforgettable harangue, saying that the
Day when the tolls should be taken off the Bridge
and the gates thrown down would stand in the
annals of his country next to its historic Charter
and its acceptance of the Truth Faith. Amid the
deafening shouts of a vast concourse, composed,
as I was amused to discover, of both parties indifferently,
but all out for the occasion, this great
official proceeded in state to the entrance of the
bridge, cut symbolically the silken thread with
which the gates upon either end had been tied and
in loud tones declared the bridge open in the name
of Allah and his Prophet. Women wept profusely
and even strong men had difficulty in hiding
their emotion; only the younger of the children
and the animals accompanying the procession
appeared indifferent. Of the four officials
deputed for the watching of the tolls two were
thrown into jail on the charge of malversation;
the other two were, on my making an appeal for
them, allowed to leave the country.</p>

<p>“The head of the opposing party who had done
his best to defeat this great and necessary reform
now, upon payment, openly admitted that
he was converted; whatever sentimental attachment
he might still cherish for his old views, he
now clearly saw that they were no longer practical
politics.</p>

<p>“The gardens of the city were illuminated for
three successive nights, cannon were fired and in
view of the quite exceptional character of the
occasion many criminals were pardoned, including<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the young brother of the head of the opposition
who, under an assumed name, had languished in
jail for several months.</p>

<p>“In all this enthusiasm it was easier to get
through the practical details of the change, as the
obstacle of petty detailed criticism proceeding
from an ignorant public was removed.</p>

<p>“A new Constitution was happily agreed upon
in place of the old revenue from tolls. This old
revenue had fluctuated between the annual
amounts of 15,000 and 25,000 dinars. To replace
it and to allow for all contingencies a fixed sum
of 30,000 dinars was put aside as an annual
charge upon the public rates to be allocated to
the Service of the Bridge. This sum would, of
course, in the natural course of things have been
paid annually to myself. But I had other plans.</p>

<p>“After this decision to allocate 30,000 dinars
had been arrived at by a unanimous vote I created
a very favourable impression when I rose in
my place and said that I would never occupy the
privileged and, in my view, corrupt position of a
citizen drawing a regular pension from my fellows.
However great my services had been in the
past, I was glad that they should be at the disposal
of my country—for so I called the place,
having lived in it now two years and more. I
could not bear to think that I was, as it were,
sucking the very life-blood of the community and
drawing into my private coffers pence which had
been contributed, for the most part, by the humblest
of my dear countrymen.</p>

<p>“Agreement had already been shown with this
announcement—which came from the depth of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
heart—when the Council was overjoyed to hear
my conclusion. It was, if anything, even more
sincere. ‘I will accept,’ said I, ‘<i>if you really insist
upon it</i>, a sum of money down which might represent
the capitalized value of the revenue, but I
absolutely refuse upon any terms whatsoever to
remain a mere drone supported by this active commercial
community, skimming the cream off the
taxes and feeling myself a burden where I should
be an aid.’</p>

<p>“Applause was almost unknown in the dignified
debates of our assembly, but upon this occasion
it could not be restrained; for some minutes
together the grave but voluminous cheers of my
colleagues assured me that I had done right and
amply compensated me for any loss that I might
suffer, supposing (which was, after all, improbable)
the revenue from the bridge in the future
would largely rise.</p>

<p>“Such is the frailty of human nature that perhaps
the recognition of my good deed would have
been less frank, or less simple, had the Council
themselves been compelled to find the money out
of their own pockets. But there was no question
of this. The burden must fall, as was only just,
upon the whole body of citizens, since all used the
bridge. My proposal met therefore with enthusiastic
assent from every side, and one speaker in
the ensuing debate (a friend who, in his humble
way, was associated with other of my lesser enterprises)
pointed out what I could not in decency
have alluded to, that I also was a taxpayer, and
a large one; so that any public payment was borne
partly by myself. The Sheik, in closing the dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>cussion,
after a few compliments which my natural
modesty forbids me to repeat, said that
clearly nothing was now left but to make a computation—a
mere matter of book-keeping—and
that this detail might safely be left to a small
committee of three, which was nominated upon the
spot; their work was of course honorary, for they
were men of high standing; but I saw to it that all
their expenses and other disbursements should be
met and I gave them much hospitality. The Committee
met at intervals during the ensuing three
weeks. I appeared frequently before this Committee
in the capacity of witness, I produced all
my books and had, I am glad to say, the restraint
and good feeling to let things take their course
and not to haggle as though this great public settlement
had been a private commercial deal. It is
enough to say that at the end of this proceeding
the sum of 1,400,000 dinars was awarded to me
by the arbitrators and that I, after protesting
against what I called the excessive generosity of
the State, then added to my popularity by erecting
at my own charges a fine gate of entry at the city
end of the bridge which absorbed half the odd
400,000; the other half I gave in a burst of generosity
to the members of the committee: not of
course in their public capacity but privately, as
being my personal friends, and in reward for their
untiring public spirit.</p>

<p>“I was left with a million.</p>

<p>“I was fully content.</p>

<p>“I desired no more.”</p>

<p>“But, uncle,” timidly interrupted the eldest of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the nephews, “I am puzzled by one thing. Will
you allow me to ask you a question upon it?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear lad,” said the old man,
stroking his beard and awaiting the query.</p>

<p>“Why, uncle,” said the boy, still hesitating
somewhat, “it is this. I do not quite see how it
came that you should have a million dinars. You
came to this place with <i>half</i> a million, how then
did it become <i>one</i> million?”</p>

<p>The folly of the question raised a titter from
his brothers, who had always regarded their senior
as the least brilliant of their clan. But their
uncle was more lenient and checked their mirth
(which was especially loud in the youngest), and
said:</p>

<p>“My dear boy, do you see anything extraordinary
in an accretion of fortune to a man who
served the community so well?”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly that,” said the elder nephew,
still hesitating, “far from it, dear uncle; but what
I do not quite clearly see is where the other half-million
came from.”</p>

<p>“Foolish lad!” answered his relative, now
touched with annoyance. “It came from my untiring
devotion to the public service, from my
foresight in providing a magnificent bridge which
for all those years no one had attempted; from
the freely expressed desire of my fellow-citizens
through their honoured representatives. It was,
indeed, but a small recompense for all the good
I had done and all the immeasurable advantage to
this town which my energy had created.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear uncle, but ...” went on the blushing
lad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, don’t listen to him,” cried his brothers in
chorus. “You will never make him understand!
Our father has always said that he could not even
do his arithmetic,” and the shrill laugh of the
youngest was heard at the end of his protest.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Mahmoud good-naturedly,
“we will not quarrel about it.”</p>

<p>At that moment the intolerable shriek of the
Muezzin calling the Faithful to prayer was heard
from the neighbouring minaret and the somewhat
strained situation was relieved.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">When</span>
his nephews next filed into the presence
of Mahmoud at the hour of public
executions their first act was to stand in a line
and salaam; their next to push forward the eldest,
who with much catching up of himself and in
the humblest tones, desired to apologize to his
uncle for the interruption of which he had been
guilty during their last audience.</p>

<p>“It is not my fault, Revered Sir,” said he,
“that I was born a little thick-headed in the matter
of figures. The whole thing has been explained
to me most fully by my father, my mother, my
brothers, and sundry guests that came in last
night after the evening meal: to which (alas!) we
could not afford to invite them. I now see very
clearly where and how a million can become two
without breeding, and I only hope that in the further
story of your adventures we shall find
miraculously increasing with every year the fortune
which the Almighty bestowed upon you in
reward for your ceaseless efforts to benefit mankind.”</p>

<p>Having said this the lad bowed once more in
deep obeisance, while, at a signal from one of their
uncle’s attendant slaves, all the brothers sank
cross-legged to the floor and assumed expressions
of the most enraptured attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>“There was no need,” said the old man kindly,
“to refer again to this unfortunate little affair;
but since you have done so I am indeed glad to
learn that your difficulties have been explained
away. No doubt your excellent father, my
brother, and his guests made it plain to you that,
if anything, my reward had been far below that
to which I was morally entitled. For a man who
not only builds for a city a fine bridge but also,
from a pure public spirit, leaves it open and free
to all, is worthy of very high reward indeed at the
hands of the Commonwealth. But, to tell the
truth, though I am not indifferent to success in
any task I take up, I was not so much concerned
with the worldly advantage of my increased fortune
as with the good I had done, and with the
knowledge that it would add to my glory in paradise.
For it is written: ‘<i>Three works are remembered
on high: The building of a bridge, the
digging of a well, and the pulling down of poor
men’s houses.</i>’</p>

<p>“In the last part of what you said (my dear
nephews), I fear you will be disappointed; for
the story I have to tell to-day” (and here his voice
fell to a graver tone) “is one of strange disaster.</p>

<p>“I desire you to bear my losses even more
closely in mind than the previous accounts of my
rising fortunes or than those other accounts which
will follow and will show how I recovered my
standing in the world. For it would indeed be a
poor service I should do you young people if I
were to leave you under the error that energy and
adventure alone add gold to gold: no, nor even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
cunning. For there is also the Will of the Supreme.</p>

<p>“What is the Sleight of Hand or Eye, without
Him?” asked the old Merchant in a rapture (as
his youngest nephew cleverly swallowed a yawn).
“Do you hope for gain by the folly of your dupe
or even by your own stupidity? It is far otherwise!</p>

<p>“Our Sacred Books present us with many an example
of good men whom the Infinite Mercy has
seen fit to try. It is our conduct under these
ordeals which are the true test of character and
the only foundations of our future and eternal
reward. By so much as I ascribe to the Mercy of
Allah whatever goods have befallen me, by so
much do I ascribe to His inscrutable wisdom and
kindness even the sharp reverses of this life. For
by these we learn that there is an element of speculation
in all business; that we are surrounded by
the competition of rivals whom we should never
despise; that our friends ever lie in wait to outwit
us. It is only by the humble acceptation of
such lessons that we become even more acute in
dealing with our fellow-beings than we were before
we had suffered loss.</p>

<p>“However, I will not delay, but proceed at once
to the harrowing tale. For you must now follow
your poor uncle through dark and distressing
days.” As he said these words the features of his
young relatives betrayed the utmost concern;
none more than those of the youngest, the great
pathos of whose expression oddly assorted with
the innocence of his years.</p>

<p>“You must know, then,” began the old man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
“that my prime error at this moment in my
career, was a desire for ease. I thought (I say it
to my shame!) that I had made enough. To use
the familiar language of the market I regarded
my present fortune of a million dinars as my
‘pile.’ To use another phrase which you will
come across very frequently in your maturer
years, I was ready to retire.</p>

<p>“Oh, fatal error! Oh, profound ingratitude!
Here was I, still in the vigour of early manhood—for
I had but just attained my thirtieth year, on
the full tide of an apparent success, blessed in all
my doings—and yet already with a paltry million
in hand so ungrateful to God as to entertain a
shameful temptation to leisure! The result shall
be a warning to you, I hope, and to any who may
come across this recital.</p>

<p>“The insidious poison of content had, all unknown
to myself, wormed its way into my heart.
I had (for the moment at least) wearied of getting
the better of others—which should be the
chief activity of a man; I was already toying with
such fripperies as the reading of books, the contemplation
of fine manuscripts, the designing of a
house for myself, the planning of gardens, futile
conversation with the learned, and, worst of all,
the taking of an interest in the past. Beyond this
foolish bent for acquiring knowledge of dead
things, I descended to the pen! I actually began
to write. To the writing of verse (I humbly
thank God!) I never fell, but had not a sharp
chastisement brought me to my senses I might
have come to it.</p>

<p>“You know, perhaps, my dear nephews, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
there are some men so lost to all shame that on
finding themselves possessed of a considerable
sum they will not embark it in commerce nor even
lend it out at interest to the widow and the orphan,
to the teachers of our holy religion, or to districts
struck by famine; indeed, they make no lucrative
employment of it, but, yielding to a base appetite
for repose, they draw upon it as they need until it
is wholly exhausted.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how shocking!” piped a shrill voice, interrupting
the merchant in his eloquence. The
cry proceeded from the youngest.</p>

<p>“You feel strongly, my little fellow,” said his
uncle, “and you are quite right. I am delighted
to find that one so young has already so sound a
sense of our duty in the battle of life. There are,
I repeat, men so despicable that they will put their
substance aside, taking from it what they need
from day to day, until one of these two events
befalls them: at the worst they live too long and
spend their last miserable years in destitution:
at the best (and it is a poor best) they live too
short, and have the infinite mortification, in the
agony of death, to discover that they might have
had some slightly larger income had they made a
more exact calculation.</p>

<p>“I am speaking frankly to you, my nephews (in
spite of the difference in our ages and of the
respect you owe me as the head of the family),
when I confess so great a depth of degradation
as this. I did not put this million which I had
acquired aside. I used it fruitfully. But my
mind was occupied (even after so many years I
blush to recall it!) in seeking some secure and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
permanent form of revenue, so that I should be
free henceforth from the labour and risk of buying
cheap and selling dear, and from the duty of
hunting the dupe and the incompetent.</p>

<p>“While I was revolving in my mind how best
I might obtain this leisure there came to me my
temptation. For a traveller arriving in the City
of the Bridge let it be known to the merchants of
the place that the King of an Island called Izmar,
one day’s sail from the coast (a kingdom renowned
throughout Asia for its fidelity to the
Prophet, the antiquity of its customs, the solidity
of its institutions), required a loan.</p>

<p>“‘For what purpose?’ I asked him.</p>

<p>“‘I know not,’ he answered, ‘but I think it is
in order to pay back another loan which he contracted
some years ago in the effort to pay another
loan which his father had contracted when a few
years previously he had been compelled to repay
an earlier loan.’</p>

<p>“I admired the scrupulous anxiety of this monarch
and was the more confirmed in the project
that was forming in my mind. That very night
I bade farewell, not without grief, to the City of
the Bridge. I sold my slaves and my house at
some loss (such was my infatuation!) and before
it was light started out upon a good horse, carrying
with me my million dinars reduced to one hundred
thousand pieces of gold which, in this form,
could easily be carried upon a few pack animals
that followed me with their drivers.</p>

<p>“My passage of the sea was easy. I saw, at the
rising of the sun, fine mountains against the
South and very soon I discerned at their base on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the shore, the walls, the piers, the minarets of a
great city, its flanks upon the edges of the sea. So
did I land under a good augury.</p>

<p>“Everything in the place, as I passed through
it, smiled at my project. The wealth of the great
houses, the busy commerce of the streets, the port
quite filled with shipping from every place, the
sounds of strange tongues (men not only from all
Islam, but Nazarenes also, and Kafir, and merchants
of China), the excellent order everywhere
about, all these promised me the security which
I desired.</p>

<p>“I put on my best raiment, finely fringed, and
all my jewels and presented myself to the Port-Master
as upon a matter of state business, handing
him at the same time, in a lofty manner, a roll
which I begged to have delivered to the Controllers
of the Treasury. The Master of the Port
treated me with the reverence my wealth deserved.
I reposed for an hour in the court of his house,
resting to the pleasant trickle of a fountain and
waiting the pleasure of the authorities. At the
end of that time a dozen horsemen magnificently
mounted and bearing the insignia of the King
formed before the porch of my host. Their commander
set foot to the ground and begged me
with a very low salaam to mount and ride. It
would be his privilege, he said, to hold my bridle.</p>

<p>“It was my design to maintain my state, and
thus, in great pomp, was I led through the busy
streets till I came to a vast archway all emblazoned
with holy texts. Passing through this,
I came into a more magnificent court than I had
thought men could have built in this world. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>deed,
the folk had made stories of it that it was
not of human handicraft, but that its delicate piers
and alabaster columns and lovely arches, lighter
and lighter as they rose to heaven, had sprung
up in a moment at the command of spirits in the
days of Soleiman, from whom the monarchs of
this happy island claimed descent.</p>

<p>“My advent was greeted with a flourish of
trumpets as though I were some sort of ambassador,
such an effect had my robes and jewels and
letter produced, and, without delay, I was conducted
by servants of the palace into the presence
of the Council.</p>

<p>“The morning was already far advanced, the
heat increasing, but the apartment in which I
found myself (which was ablaze with the most
costly tiles and hangings of the Indies) was very
cool; and again the pleasant sound of water
plashing from a scented fountain refreshed the
air.</p>

<p>“Before the throne stood, in respectful order,
the twelve councillors of the King; and He himself,
upon a marble throne, exquisite in workmanship
and venerable with age, sat: a young man
of a dreamy, melancholy, but pleasing countenance,
who bowed his head very slightly at my
approach, smiled gently as he did so and welcomed
me. Such was the King. I in my turn cast myself
down before him with a full obeisance until he
bade me rise.</p>

<p>“Our business was not long in concluding. The
Grand Vizier, who stepped up and stood on the
right hand of the throne, put me certain questions—Whether
I had my treasure with me?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Whether I could produce it by such a date? And
so forth. I satisfied him by signalling to my attendants
with their burdens. The packages were
opened before the eyes of the Council and at that
sitting all was arranged. For the terms which I
proposed were discovered suitable enough. I have
told you, my dear nephews (and I do confess it
again to my shame), that desire for ease had now
taken place in my mind, whereas further gain
should have occupied it. I very modestly asked
for no more than five dinars yearly on the hundred,
I told the Council and his Majesty that for
the million dinars which could here be counted I
should ask annually but fifty thousand for revenue,
and that paid on such dates as they thought fit.</p>

<p>“All nodded gravely; the King gently complimented
me upon my public spirit, for now (as he
was good enough to say) he regarded me as a
subject.</p>

<p>“He looked round among his councillors as
though seeking a suggestion, when one of them,
Tarib by name (whom I distinguished by his fine
intelligent face and felt drawn towards already),
said in a firm voice, ‘The Salt Tax,’ and all, including
the King himself, murmured approval.</p>

<p>“Then did I learn that for many generations
past the people of this wealthy and fortunate
realm had paid to the State a fixed tax upon salt,
which amounted yearly, upon the average, to the
sum I had demanded. It was regularly received;
for all the salt of this land came over sea and the
toll was levied at the ports of entry. A Charter
was drawn up by the Council in simple terms. It
was agreed by my own wish that my name should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
not be published to the people, lest, perhaps, the
odium of receiving tribute should attach to one so
recently come among them. But the King assured
me, as he signed, that not odium, but gratitude,
was my due: he for his part would never cease to
believe that I had been moved to make so generous
an offer by some particular affection for
himself and his people.</p>

<p>“Rooms within the palace were set at my disposal
until I should have time to choose some
house in the city, and through the importance of
my connexion with the State I was sworn of the
Council with the rest.</p>

<p>“As I read my Charter through all alone in
the privacy of my room I noted with pleasure the
short and simple phrasing of this great commercial
people:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“‘<i>To Mahmoud, his assignees and heirs for
ever and ever, so long as the State shall last,
and the Salt Tax be gathered</i>’</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">ran the what is called among the mighty ‘The
Operative Clause: the Words of Power.’ I had
them by heart in a moment. I could not forbear
to write them down in my own hand more than
once, for the pleasure it gave me.</p>

<p>“Here then was my every wish fulfilled! Here
was the best of company, the most dignified of
position, the most charming of climates, surroundings
of wealth, luxury and ease; the culture of a
thousand years; all that our religion permits in
art and entertainment. Books of every language
and climate. Stores of good from every sky under
heaven, from every people and of every age.
Here, indeed, might I live my life without further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
adventure or negotiation. What pleased me most
was to think that I would be able to escape some
little strains I might have to put upon my
honour—though not I am glad to say upon my
conscience—in the rude struggle of the outer
world. No one here knew my humble beginnings,
or in too much detail the particular abilities
whereby I had so rapidly enriched myself.</p>

<p>“I was now one of the great lords, and very
soon the foundation of my fortune would be lost in
the mists of time. Men would easily come to
believe that my fathers had acquired it, sword in
hand, when first the banner of the Prophet was
seen upon those hills three hundred years before.</p>

<p>“I will not detain you with the happy disposition
of my time, nor with more than the statement
of my supreme enjoyment. Scrolls from every
land I accumulated in my library, I had about me
the most costly stuffs and upon my person and
upon those of my attendants the rarest gems. My
chief delight was to gather at my table a small,
but various, band of intimates; chief of whom was
that earnest, intelligent young man of the Council
whom I noted on my first arrival. Tarib, as I
have told you, was his simple name; and I
learned how his father had been no more than a
respected merchant in offal. Dying, he had left
his son a sufficient income, and that son had so
added to it by occasions of public service that he
had now risen to one of the highest offices of State.
It was his special function in the Council to represent
and to retail to the King whatever popular
movement was abroad, for he was known to every
class in the city. He was the intermediary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
between King and people, was regarded in some
way as a Tribune: or, as his title went, ‘The
Doubler,’ which term, already centuries old, some
derived from his double function, others from the
attitude which etiquette demanded him to assume
to Monarch and subjects alike. Others again put
it down to the emoluments of his post.</p>

<p>“Through him I learned to understand this
kindly, industrious and most loyal people. In
my walks with him, and by my regular attendance
at his public addresses, I grew intimate with that
character in the people of Izmat which had led to
their great reputation throughout the world.</p>

<p>“It was their pride that they never shook the
State by violent change, but with gradual and well-weighed
reforms adapted themselves generation
by generation to the movement of the world. They
thought disdainfully of nationalities controlled by
less powerful traditions; for a man of great fortune
like myself, it was therefore an ever-pleasing
thought—the foundation I might say of my happiness—to
consider the peace and solidity all about
me. That portion of the populace (about one
half) which lay upon the verge of starvation were
manfully content with their lot, or, if they showed
some beginning of complaint, were at once appeased
when they had pointed out to them their
superiority over the miserable foreigners of the
Mainland; while those who (like myself) were possessed
of vast revenues and lived in great palaces
were far too devoted to the Commonwealth to
dream of grumbling at their lot. They would,
upon the contrary, frequently express their devotion
to State and King, and prove it by doing for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the common weal, unpaid, as much as three hours’
work in a day; or even four when there was a
press of business.</p>

<p>“Thus, one would maintain the magnificent
breed of horses by his devotion to the chase; another
would support the industry of the goldsmith
by his frequent purchase of ornaments; another
would, as a local magistrate, condemn the poorest
of his district to various terms of imprisonment;
another, though in no way bound to do so, would
write a book—the description, perhaps, of his
tastes in food, or a recollection of those men and
women of the wealthier sort whom he had met in
the course of his useful life. Yet another would
contribute to the health of the State by the continual
practice of commerce, to which these people
were very much devoted. There was hardly one
of this rich class in which I now mixed, but had
his chosen work thoroughly accomplished. The
content of the poor, the public spirit of the rich,
welded the whole of that society into a sort of
paradise; but most noble of all and most worthy
of this people was this young Tribune Tarib.</p>

<p>“He it was who talked most incessantly and
before the largest gatherings, thus creating a taste
for public discussion. He it was who discussed
practical remedies whenever discontent appeared,
and he who worked out every detail in the interesting
reports upon the condition of the starving.
To the thousands whom he addressed his manner
never grew stale. His eloquence was sober, his
speeches with praise of Izmat and quotations from
the Sacred Books, as also with known jests—things
which this practical people infinitely pre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>ferred
to empty theories of the Mainland. So all
went well; and I (blind to the future, alas!) went
down that path of statesmanship along which my
friend led me, little knowing whither it would lead
me.</p>

<p>“I did not often speak myself at the public meetings
so frequently held (they were indeed the
noble pastime of this patriot folk), lest my foreign
accent should hurt my dignity. For I had not yet
a complete command of the language, though it
was now two years since I had become a citizen
and subject of the Monarch to whom we were all
so devoted. But I would sit by the side of my
friend Tarib and others as they harangued the
populace in the open places of the city or, upon
occasions, in the mosques. On such occasions I
would show by my smiles and applause my approval
of all that was said for the betterment of
the poor or the rich, as the case might be, and I
always laughed at the ritual jests, sometimes even
before they were delivered. In this way I grew
familiar with most of those in the capital and with
many of the provincial towns, and hoped to conquer
general favour.</p>

<p>“I was present when Ibn Rashn delivered his
great harangue to a vast assembly, denouncing
the foreign practice of marrying a fifth wife—which
abomination there was some danger of seeing
introduced into his beloved land. I was present
also when the same great and eloquent man
gave his second great harangue, insisting upon the
necessity of fifth wives and carrying that reform
by acclamation as a law. Seated with others on
the raised platform which surrounded the orator<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
I applauded the Grand Vizier in his solemn declaration
against shaving, a thing (said he) abhorrent
to every true believer, and heard the sway of argument
for and against the custom; which (I am
glad to say) was afterwards put down with the
utmost severity of the law. But my happiest
memories are still of those numerous days when
my intimate the Tribune Tarib—who could never
be accused of any petty thing—poured forth his
soul upon the poverty of the commons and extolled
to them the national pride and glory of
doing nothing to change it: in which principles he
was applauded with frenzy. This spirit was
peculiar to this happy land and no one expressed
it in wiser or more memorable terms than he who
was now my bosom friend.</p>

<p>“But there came a time—I had been in Izmat
about three years—when it was clearly necessary
to strike a new note.</p>

<p>“There was at the moment of which I speak
some little commotion in the city on account of a
dearth of rice, the diet of the poorer classes, or
at least the diet of the poorer classes when they
could obtain it; for there was a custom deeply
rooted in this conservative people that when the
poorer classes could not obtain rice, they should
do without it.</p>

<p>“At this juncture the difficulty had risen to the
middle classes, and these joined with the populace.
Ill ease grew general. A complaint of
stringency was abroad, from the ranks of those
who starved to death up to the merchants and
the lords themselves. Even the moderately rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
could no longer afford the services of more than
a dozen dancing girls.</p>

<p>“The whole Island was in a ferment and the
capital was so disturbed that one might have
thought oneself at times among the degraded
tribes of the Mainland.</p>

<p>“Processions had appeared in the streets, sometimes
actually accompanied by musical instruments
of a loud and distressing order. Banners
had been carried, and upon one occasion the litter
of no less a person than the Lord Executioner had
been detained for half an hour in a block caused
by the multitudes proceeding to hear a favourite
orator. The Council had taken note of these
things and my friend the Tribune Tarib, the Lord
Doubler, was naturally deputed to deal with them
in his own inimitable way.</p>

<p>“He went on foot to the vast meeting that had
been convened in the Mosque of Nasr-ed-din the
founder of the Dynasty. We also went with him
thus humbly, the better to please the public eye.
With some dozen others of my rank I sat upon a
rug immediately at the foot of the orator and listened
entranced to his impassioned words.</p>

<p>“Never had I heard him more inspired! It was
a great volume of sound, the words in which
followed each other in quick succession, often
meaningless but never pedantic, and throughout
the speech he was careful to interpolate short
passages which the meanest intellect could
clearly follow and which exactly corresponded to
the desires of his hearers. ‘Why should you
starve?’ cried he, ‘while all around you is wealth?
Which the wealthy will be the first to forego.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Murmurs of applause burst from the lips of the
Treasurer and the Grand Vizier, while I myself—I
am not ashamed to say—cried aloud in my enthusiasm
for the sentiment. ‘Why,’ said he, ‘do
you lack your poor pittance of rice while the
bloated rich’—and he looked round at the galleries
as though to find them there—‘have their fill of
the tenderest lamb stuffed with pistachio nuts?
And who shall blame them?’ Again there rose a
wave of applause in which I joined more heartily
than ever, for the words reminded me of that
delicious viand, which I had, but an hour before,
very plentifully consumed. ‘Why,’—he shouted
in louder tones—‘Why do you permit yourselves
to be loaded with an intolerable burden of taxation?
Which our wealthier classes bear also in
an immoderate degree?’</p>

<p>“At this phrase the exultation of the Lord Chief
Treasurer knew no bounds, and he led the stream
of cheering which it so richly deserved. ‘How
long are we to wait for that reform which our
fathers—especially among the gentry—demanded
and so nearly obtained?’ He looked round upon
them for a moment in a dramatic pause, and then
said in solemn tones, ‘A tax upon the <i>worthless
rich</i>, and more especially’ (yet louder) ‘upon the
<i>alien</i> rich and more especially still’ (his voice now
booming like a hammering of drums) ‘upon the
alien rich who stand <i>idle</i> fattening upon the revenues
of the State, this I say....’ But the
delirium of acquiescence aroused by this noble
sentiment cut off the rest of his phrase and
drowned his voice for the space in which a man
might recite the prayer for the Caliph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Used as I was to this style of public eloquence
and the expression of opinions universal to this
happy people (bound up, as I thought, with the
very atmosphere of their race) I naturally expected
that when the dying down of the applause
should have allowed him to be heard we should
have that second part of which his speeches had
always consisted—an appeal to the conservative
instincts of our race, to their noble patience and
to their dogged tenacity in doing nothing which
had made them the envy of their less-gifted
neighbours.</p>

<p>“Bitterly was I undeceived!</p>

<p>“For what were his very next words? I could
hardly believe my ears as those words fell upon
me. ‘Why,’ said he in grave and tragic tones,
slowly separating them syllable by syllable, ‘why
do you thus remain ground down by such an
iniquity as the tax upon <span class="smcap">Salt</span>?’</p>

<p>“My heart stood still. I ventured discreetly to
touch his foot with that one of my own which was
nearest. He replied by treading heavily upon my
toe, which I interpreted as a signal of secret
friendship. But I was terribly concerned to note
that the native Lords around, squatted upon the
same platform as myself, wagged their heads in
unison when this monstrous suggestion was made,
and by their murmurs of agreement interrupted
the awful silence which followed.</p>

<p>“That silence did not last for long. Once more,
but with stronger decision, with larger hope, there
arose from the vast assembly the same tumult of
applause. Every man rose to his feet. Someone
began to sing, then all sang in unison their famous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
hymn, which asks in stirring words and air
whether one Hussein shall die and asserts with
the utmost vehemence that if this most unfortunate
event should come to pass no less than
twenty thousand inhabitants of the peninsula
province of Bar-el-sul would demand a full explanation
of the occurrence. The words might
not seem apposite to a stranger, but in the dignified
and strongly national atmosphere of Izmat
their purport is well understood. They can be
suited to almost any occasion of popular passion,
and at this moment most undoubtedly might be
interpreted to mean ‘<i>To Eblis with the Salt Tax</i>.’</p>

<p>“I was by this time frozen to my marrow. I
was bewildered. I could hardly doubt the friendship
between Tarib and myself. I had shown him
so many favours. Even now, as I looked at him,
I found him very sympathetic—and so familiar!
I could not doubt the force of familiar converse,
I could not doubt my hosts and colleagues, the
Councillors, who had for now three years sat with
me round His Majesty in Divan and worked with
me as one of the Chief Ministers there.</p>

<p>“The next words slightly, but only slightly, reassured
me. They were more after the style I
knew so well, when, in the past, the national glory
in doing nothing had been expressed with peculiar
skill. The Lord Doubler assumed a piteous expression
and his mouth, the shape of which might
now be compared to that of a horseshoe, opened.
‘Let me not stir you up, my friends,’ said he, ‘to
a violent anger. We can leave froth and vindictive
folly to the pitiful peoples of the mainland. We
in Izmat, thanks be to Allah, will never lose our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
dignity in mere brawling. Let us confine ourselves
to constitutional means, the only ones
whereby anything practical can be accomplished.’
Applause also met these sentiments, more subdued,
indeed, than that which we had first heard,
but sincere. ‘My friends around me,’ and he
smiled on all the Councillors, including myself,
‘will deliberate, as we always do, for the public
good, and you will find that our recommendations
thus laid before His Majesty, with the ensuing
Proclamation, will be the beginning of better
things. We cannot say that all this evil shall be
redressed at once. We are a practical people, as
I think I have remarked before. You have indeed
cried to me for redress; but we are, I say it
again, a practical people. We do not attempt the
impossible or tear up the ancient framework of
our State. Step by step is our motto. One thing
at a time. The advance of His Majesty’s subjects
in freedom and happiness has increased in
breadth by imperceptible degrees from one decision
in the past to another, as our great poet has
so admirably put it; and again, not once or twice
in the far from smooth sequence of our insular
activities has the mere fulfilment of our daily
tasks proved an approach to distinction.’ These
verses (which in the original form noble lines of
poetry) made a fitting conclusion to one of those
great speeches which from time to time determined
the fate of Izmat.</p>

<p>“We all rose; the audience and the Councillors
and the orator himself united in chanting that portion
of the Koran which details Mahomet’s visit
to the moon (a religious exercise dear to this folk).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
We then sang an invocation to Allah that he might
protect His Majesty the King and throw any hypothetical
enemies of that monarch into the utmost
confusion. Then we filed out of the Mosque in
our thousands to the coolness of the declining day.
That great, that historic, that fatal meeting had
occupied four hours!</p>

<p>“The Council was immediately summoned, and
their first action, after their obeisance to the King
upon his throne, was to assure me, individual by
individual, that no idea of any attack upon me had
been for one moment intended.</p>

<p>“‘It is, my dear Mahmoud,’ said the Grand
Vizier, placing his hand familiarly upon mine as
it lay listless upon my knee, ‘it is the <i>principle</i> of
the matter which we must consider. That is it.’
He pressed my hand on the other side. ‘For
yourself, Mahmoud, as you know, we have a
respect which exceeds all bounds, but we must
move with the times. Things are not what they
were. Evolution is better than revolution. If we
do not reform ourselves, things will reform us.
Mend it or end it. What did the Sultan Omar say
in the thirty-seventh year of the Flight of the
Prophet?’</p>

<p>“These commonplaces fell mournfully upon my
ears. I made no attempt to reply. His Majesty
was pleased to say a few sympathetic words. The
Tribune Tarib, who evidently felt embarrassed by
my position and by his memories of our past
friendship, most earnestly protested that his
whole object had been to stem the growing dangerous
demand—nay, he would go so far as to say
perilous demand; nay more, a minatory demand;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
yea, a threatening demand. Had he not stemmed
the demand as he had it would have had tremendous
consequences in the way of demand. The
great lord whose special function on the Council
was solemnity and who was known by the title of
His Impressiveness, opened his mouth in the midst
of his prodigious beard to say that he thoroughly
agreed with these sentiments.</p>

<p>“For my part I said nothing, but sat mournfully,
seeing no issue and attending the pleasure
of those who could do what they would with me
and mine. I heard their debate: I was asked to
sign their conclusions. I did so with a reluctant,
unwilling hand; and as I signed my name in its
place and affixed my seal I glanced at the wording
of the Proclamation and felt some relief to discover
that the Salt Tax was not abolished, but only
halved, while the loss so occasioned was to be made
good by a tax upon revenue of one dinar in each
hundred—a very moderate amount.</p>

<p>“After this dreadful session (the date will remain
engraved upon my soul to my dying day!—it
was the anniversary of the day upon which my
grandfather, your great grandfather, dear boys,
had been hanged) I paced up and down in my
courtyard alone, no longer soothed by the ceaseless
whisper of my beloved fountains, in no mood
for taking down any one of my famous scrolls, nor
even for toying with the numerous Circassians
whom I had imported at vast expense during the
preceding months. My bosom and my brow were
contracted and I was weary of life.</p>

<p>“But after some hours of these mournful reflections
some considerations of hope occurred to me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
‘After all,’ said I to myself, ‘there must be ups
and downs. Many a man has lost a fortune and
recovered it. My income is halved, but what
remains is still ample.’ I could yet call myself
an extremely wealthy man—among the wealthiest
in the State. The small tax put upon my revenue
I could not grudge, since it fell also upon the revenues
of others.</p>

<p>“But I was to learn what bitter truth there lay
behind the oft-repeated boast of these people that
they proceeded step by step, slowly, one thing at a
time, etc., etc., etc. Not a month had passed but a
modification was issued to the first regulation and
it was ordained, in view of certain rumours which
had been heard in the market-place, that the tax
on revenue should be of a more complicated kind.
It was to <i>begin</i>, indeed, at one dinar in the hundred,
but since it was harsh to apply even this
small burden to the poorer citizens, only those
receiving at least one thousand dinars should pay,
and the proportion was to rise rapidly with the
larger fortunes until, for such a man as myself,
the proportion reached one quarter of the total!
But worse was to come.</p>

<p>“Yielding to the vigorous popular clamour, the
tax was doubled for those of alien birth. For
those whose income was derived in any way from
the revenues of State the tax was doubled again.
Exception was made for the Councillors, for (so
ran the Proclamation) their salaries are paid by
his Majesty, and a diminution of them would but
take money with one hand to give it back to the
other. I hoped for one wild moment that I should
come within so clear a category. But no! In a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
further clause it was specially indicated that this
should apply only to salaries actually paid by the
Treasury and not to annuities guaranteed by, or
derived from, the public revenue directly—and my
payment alone was of this kind in all the Council!</p>

<p>“Still more was to follow. An infamous new
regulation appeared whereby a man should pay,
not upon that which he actually received, but
upon that which he had received in the course of
three years—a space of time exactly corresponding
to my presence in the island and attaching to
my vast income of the past. It was clear that I
was ruined. I made a brief calculation on the
night after the last of these official Acts had been
published. After taking this survey of my remaining
wealth (I had already sold the most part
of my movables, and had removed from my great
palace to a humble lodging) I discovered that I
had left in my hands, all told, less than one thousand
dinars.</p>

<p>“I knew not how to look upon the world. My
whole being seemed to have departed. I watched
the day fading, and with it faded my spirit. I returned
to my poor room and, very late, lost, or
half-lost, my miseries in an imperfect slumber.”</p>

<p>The old man concluded and bowed his head in
a solemn silence. His young nephews appreciating
how sacred a thing is death, especially the
death of Money, glided on tiptoe out of the room
and vanished.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
  <small>ENTITLED <i>AL-WUKALÁ</i>, OR THE LAWYERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">When</span>
the nephews next entered their uncle’s
presence at the Hour of Public Executions,
it was in a subdued manner, as to a funeral, for
their thoughts were full of that Great Loss, the
story of which was in progress. They sat upon
the floor before him in due order, and Mahmoud
began:</p>

<p>“Upon the dawn that followed that hopeless
night, my hopes were again raised, only for my
further bitterness and disappointment. I had
risen before day and gone out of doors. A chance
acquaintance ran across me as I paced aimlessly
in the narrow streets of the city, watching the
shadows shortening under the rising sun, listening
to the clear voices of the water-sellers and to the
cries of the mariners at their calling.</p>

<p>“This acquaintance was one learned in the law.
Not that he was himself a scrivener, or pleader,
still less a judge—on the contrary, he was born
wealthy, and those so circumstanced are (in
Izmat) very much averse to the tedium of a profession.
But in youth he had been compelled by
his grandfather to read whole libraries of books
upon the legal system of his beloved country, and
had further been compelled to pay considerable
sums to one of the most renowned pleaders of the
day in whose office he had passed three miserable
years. Seeing he was so educated, and knowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
well my misfortunes, he kindly took me by the arm
(I could not help suspecting a certain patronage)
and said:</p>

<p>“‘Alas, my poor Mahmoud! How we do all
feel for you! And how we respect the way in
which you have borne inevitable misfortune! But
though I praise you as much as any other for your
conduct and resignation, do you not push it a
little too far? We, the free inhabitants of this
our beloved Izmat, have a most glorious privilege,
which is, that not the King himself (the glory of
Allah be upon him) has any privilege as against
the humblest of his subjects, when it comes to the
issue of law. Our judges, as you know, stand
above all mortal frailty and are, as we devoutly
and firmly believe, filled with the spirit of God
Himself. Though His Majesty and his Ministers
be your opponents in a case, that case will be decided
with serene indifference to the position or
wealth or power of the parties. You believe this,
do you not?’ he insisted earnestly, for doubts
upon so final a doctrine of religion are horrible
to the imperial race of Izmat.</p>

<p>“‘Yes, I believe it,’ said I with a sigh, though I
confess that my short acquaintance with misfortune
had shaken me in many points of loyalty to
my new country.</p>

<p>“‘Why, then,’ said he, ‘do you not come into
Court with your plaint? Our lawyers have the
skill to discover a claim in anything, and you may
be sure that all that can be said in your favour
would be allowed in the freest manner, and if
there is a single loophole, the whole or part of
your former fortunes may be restored at whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
cost. For it is a maxim peculiar to our island law
that if a case is decided in favour of the plaintiff,
then the plaintiff has the decision in his favour.’</p>

<p>“I confess that my acquaintance with the manners
and habits of the foreign people among whom
I had had the wretched luck to be born had made
me think it futile indeed to approach the august
judges in a matter where a king was concerned, or
to ask relief from State officials for what the State
had done to me. He stoutly denied the idea I had
that the judges were State officials. Said he:
‘Have you never read the famous oath which
every judge makes on taking office? Do you not
know how we elect him?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said I, in tones which betrayed no enthusiasm,
‘I know indeed how the judges are
appointed and the oath they take. They are
appointed—(how often have I not seen the Firman
signed in Council! How often have I not affixed
my own poor name to it!)—they are appointed,
as the rule goes, “<i>by his Sacred Majesty, that is,
by the familiars, the wives, and the secretaries of
the Richest Men, indifferently</i>.” Such are the
very words of the Statute.’</p>

<p>“‘You answer rightly,’ said my friend, with a
noble carriage of his head. ‘Surely so impartial
a source of office must make you feel secure! On
the odious Mainland the king appoints his own
judges: it is a tyranny to which we in Izmat
have long refused to submit. <i>Our</i> Monarch is the
ruler of free men! He would disdain to influence
an appointment. He leaves that to his gentry,
and they, in turn, leave it to their women and
other dependents. Thus we alone of all nations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
secure a Bench of judges wholly independent!
But there is more: Have you forgotten the oath
they take, my friend—the oath they take on appointment?’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said I, still wearily. ‘I remember it
well enough. Indeed, I have it all by heart, for I
have read it a hundred times:—“<i>I swear by the
Almighty God and by the contents of this book that
I will not depart from justice in anything, either
for orders, or favours, or personal advantage, or
any consideration whatsoever, save in the political
interests of my class or family, of the Lawyers’
Guild to which I belong, or for such other considerations
as may occur to me.</i>”’</p>

<p>“‘That is right!’ said my friend in triumphant
tones. ‘Well, can you want a better guarantee?’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said I, ‘I suppose not.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, then,’ he cried, rising, ‘let me take you
to a friend of mine among the most able Scriveners
of the city, and be assured that whatever can be
done for you will be done.’</p>

<p>“‘I have no great part of my fortune left,’
said I timidly, rising as he did, but unwilling to
follow him.</p>

<p>“‘Fear nothing,’ he returned heartily. ‘Justice
in Izmat is not bought and sold. There are,
of course, certain necessary fees. But the law
compels you to hire no pleader. You can appear
yourself in Court. That freedom is one of our
great privileges; and, believe me, you will be
heard as patiently and directed as honestly as
though you were one of the greatest pleaders
in the city.’</p>

<p>“Half persuaded by such insistence, I followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
my friend to a house where, seated in the midst
of commentaries upon the law, of metal boxes containing
the shameful secrets of great families and
the record of their indebtedness, sat an elderly
man, whose face reminded me, I know not why,
of a vulture.</p>

<p>“‘I have brought you, Kazib,’ said he, ‘a
client. You will recognize him, I think.’</p>

<p>“‘I do, indeed,’ said the Scrivener, rising
gravely and bowing to me. ‘He is no less than My
Lord the Councillor Mahmoud.’</p>

<p>“‘The title is superfluous now,’ said I a little
sadly.</p>

<p>“The Scrivener, however, continued to give it
to me in his great courtesy, and when my friend
had left us together, I poured out my story. As
the more important details fell from my lips my
host jotted them down upon a small tablet with
a fine quill that he carried. When I had concluded
he spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“‘Such a case as yours would appear first in
the Court of Sweetmeats.’</p>

<p>“‘Of Sweetmeats?’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘It is an old term,’ said he. ‘We love these
historic traditions.’</p>

<p>“‘Exactly,’ I answered humbly.</p>

<p>“‘Well, it would appear, I say, in the Court of
Sweetmeats.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘After it had gone to the Court of Sweetmeats,
it would almost certainly be transferred to
the Court of Wrecks, Lighthouses and Divorce,
or to the Department of Wills.’</p>

<p>“‘Indeed?’ said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘It is so,’ said the Scrivener. ‘Whichever of
these dealt with it, an appeal would lie, of
course, to a superior court, which is generally
known as the Court of Mules.’</p>

<p>“‘Why is...’ I began.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, sir!’ interrupted the Scrivener, with
some impatience, ‘these things are immaterial!
We must use such historic names.... From
this Court again the appeal would lie, of course,
to His Majesty in Council, which is the supreme
authority of the land.’</p>

<p>“‘What,’ said I, ‘to His Majesty in Council—the
very authors of the injustice?’</p>

<p>“‘Of course,’ said the Scrivener.</p>

<p>“‘But,’ said I, ‘if the verdict is in my favour,
what reason should I have for appealing?’</p>

<p>“‘None,’ said he, simply. ‘But your opponents
would.’</p>

<p>“‘My opponents are the King and his Council,’
said I.</p>

<p>“‘In quite another aspect,’ said the Scrivener,
looking on the ground and falling silent. ‘Under
these circumstances,’ said he, after a pause, ‘you
will do very well to proceed.’</p>

<p>“‘But,’ said I, ‘in case these appeals ...’</p>

<p>“He waved his hands. ‘We will not talk of
appeals yet,’ he said quickly. ‘After all, you lose
nothing by first instance. Have you your Charter
with you?’</p>

<p>“I said I had, and brought it out for him. He
read it slowly, consulted a book for a moment,
and then said:</p>

<p>“‘An excellent case!’ (you may judge, my dear
nephews, how my heart leapt at these words!)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
‘An excellent case!... You have your Charter
and its terms are clear. By it there is bound to
be paid to you and your heirs for ever the revenue
from the Salt Tax, and the issue will lie, I think,
upon whether the clause implies payment undiminished
and perpetual, or whether the recent
Proclamations make a gumbo-rumbo of the
original.’</p>

<p>“‘A what?’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘It is a legal term,’ said he, a little wearily,
‘and signifies a mixalum-malory or general contortation....
But let us not at this stage go
into technicalities of that sort. We must first
state our case.’</p>

<p>“‘Precisely,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘My own fee,’ said he, ‘is fixed by statute, and
I must ask you for ten dinars—a nominal matter.’
With this, before I could stop him, he seized a
large metal disc, wet a corner of a parchment, put
the disc upon it, struck it with a hammer, and then
held out his hand for the fee. Luckily I had my
pouch with me, and so, very reluctantly, paid over
this first drop of my disastrous leakage.</p>

<p>“‘Good!’ said the Scrivener. ‘We must next
ask the opinion of two eminent Pleaders.’</p>

<p>“‘Why?’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘The law demands it,’ said the Scrivener.</p>

<p>“‘But you have already given me yours, and
told me it is worth my while to proceed.’</p>

<p>“‘My opinion,’ said the Scrivener, shaking his
head vigorously, ‘may serve to guide you, indeed;
but it would be altogether irregular to go into
court upon that alone. So, I will draw up a statement,
as we call it, and have it put before two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
men of the first standing—it is always better in
these cases to use the highest talent. In the long
run it is worth while.’</p>

<p>“I asked timidly how much this further step
would cost, and was somewhat relieved to learn
that fifty dinars to each of these eminent men
would be sufficient. He asked me to return on the
third day when he would give me the responses;
and he particularly reminded me that I should
upon that occasion not forget to bring with me
at least 150 dinars.</p>

<p>“‘But why the other fifty?’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘Stamps and fees,’ said the Scrivener shortly,
and then, with infinite courtesy, dismissed me
from his presence.</p>

<p>“On the third day I returned, bearing with me
the 150 dinars from my little hoard, which I put
upon the Scrivener’s table to save all further
difficulties in the matter. He poured the money
meditatively into a little metal case, beautifully
engraved, and dating, I should say, from the
second century of the Flight of the Prophet; it
was probably (to my practised eye) of Syrian
workmanship.</p>

<p>“‘Here,’ said he, ‘are the responses.’</p>

<p>“‘Have you them written?’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said he. ‘We must wait for that. The
first Pleader, by name the Most Noble Ghadder,
is of the opinion that you have a case founded
upon the great principle of our Common Law, of
which you, perhaps, as a foreigner, have not heard—it
is the principle that “The subjects of the
King can suffer no wrong.” But he warns you
against relying upon the Statute passed in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
first year of His Majesty’s father’s reign, called
“A Statute for the Prevention of the Loss of
Money by the Rich.” For this has been the subject
of so many contradictory decisions that it is
a very poor ground. He says, further, that there
are certain case precedents which are interesting,
and two of which, at least, in his judgment, could
be urged upon your side. In one of these it was
decided that if a man had more than a certain
income no Order or Proclamation should be
regarded as capable of prejudicing him or reducing
his wealth. The question would thus lie as to
whether or no at the time when the first change
took place you fell within these limits. The second
Pleader is of an exactly opposite opinion. He
says ...’</p>

<p>“‘It is enough!’ said I. ‘The first learned
Pleader shall be my guide. I am content to hear
from him that I have a good case, which doubtless
he will continue for me in court.’</p>

<p>“‘What?’ said the Scrivener, in astonishment,
‘do you suppose that such men lend their valuable
services in court for fifty dinars?’</p>

<p>“‘Evidently,’ said I, ‘as they have been so
kind as to give opinions with such nicety!’</p>

<p>“The Scrivener laughed as heartily as such men
can, and begged me to be disabused. ‘These are
but the formal stages. The hiring of pleaders is
quite another matter. Let me proceed to the
second response. The second Pleader, the Most
Noble Makhar—who, it may interest you to know,
is a negro by descent—we have many such at our
Bar, they have marvellous abilities, that strange
race—is of an opinion, I say, exactly contrary to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the other. He thinks your chance under the Common
Law very doubtful. But he thinks you are
secure under the Statute passed for the Prevention
of Cruelty to the Important—that is its
general title—dated from the first year of the
reign of His Majesty’s late father. All the cases,
he says, are against you; but the general principle
of the Statute stands.’</p>

<p>“When I had heard all this I said, ‘Oh!’</p>

<p>“The old Scrivener gazed down at the floor
between his feet, where he sat upon his rug, and
I gazed down at mine, not knowing what next to
say.</p>

<p>“‘My fee for this second interview,’ said he
pleasantly, after what he thought was a sufficient
interval, ‘is the same as for the first, ten dinars.’</p>

<p>“‘I have not brought them with me,’ I said,
having only brought the 150 dinars previously
asked for.</p>

<p>“‘It is nothing, My Lord,’ he answered, waving
his hand majestically (and again, I thought, as in
the case of my friend, with a touch of patronage).
‘We all know and respect your position of late
Councillor, and I should be the last to press you.’</p>

<p>“I begged him to wait a moment until I should
return. I hurried to my wretched lodgings and
quickly came back with the sum which he required.
He put it into the little metal box. I thought he
was ready to dismiss me, and I was about to ask
on what date the case might first be tried, when he
said, to my surprise:</p>

<p>“‘But we must first have Pleader’s Opinion.’</p>

<p>“‘But, Great Heavens!’ said I, ‘have we not
got it?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Why, no,’ said he. ‘We have not yet a
Pleader’s Opinion. We have, so far, only the
Opinion of Pleaders.’</p>

<p>“‘And what in the name of Fatimeh and
Katisha is the difference?’</p>

<p>“‘Surely,’ said he, ‘you have heard of the distinction?
The Opinion of Pleaders is the verbal
response to the Scrivener, but the law requires
that another response shall be added in writing,
and this we call Pleader’s Opinion.’</p>

<p>“Once more I could find no other commentary
but a cry.</p>

<p>“‘And at what cost?’ I moaned in a hollow
voice.</p>

<p>“He turned to a written list of fees, then to a
special memorandum of his own. He made a short
calculation upon an abacus and answered, ‘three
hundred dinars.’</p>

<p>“I kept my mouth from blasphemy and asked
him when the sum would be required.</p>

<p>“‘It is a mere formality,’ said he, ‘this written
opinion, but we must have a record.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, yes,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘And I will,’ said he, ‘take the opportunity of
obtaining the same before you come again.’</p>

<p>“Once more I returned to my disgusting rooms,
took money from my secret hoard and, returning,
put into the Scrivener’s hands a little parcel of 300
dinars. He dropped them thoughtfully through
his fingers in little streams till they nearly filled
his metal box.</p>

<p>“‘It is a pretty box, is it not?’ he said. ‘I took
it for a bad debt from one of my clients, who most
unfortunately died by his own hand in a fit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
melancholy after the most distressing disappointments
in his suits at law.’</p>

<p>“‘And as to the date?’ I said.</p>

<p>“‘The date?’ Once more he consulted another
document, then clapped his hands for the slave
who sat in his outer apartment, and having asked
him a question in some incomprehensible jargon,
received an answer no less mysterious. Then he
turned to me and said: ‘It will come on at some
date after the next New Moon but one.’</p>

<p>“‘Cannot I have a precise date?’ said I, for I
was thinking anxiously of my diminishing capital
and wondering how long I could maintain my
poor life before my cash should be completely
exhausted.</p>

<p>“‘That is obviously impossible,’ he answered
with a touch of indignation, which he evidently
thought merited. ‘No man can say how long the
cases before yours will last, nor in what order it
may please His Holiness the Judge to take them.
It will probably come, by the way,’ said he, peering
at another list, ‘before His Holiness Benshaitan.’</p>

<p>“With that I left him and waited my call to the
Court.</p>

<p>“The time dragged wearily enough. I ate most
sparingly and bought no raiment, nor even any
game to pass my time, but my little stock dwindled
day by day. My hours were spent gazing upon
the busy life of the port, or sometimes standing
on the edge of the pier and staring out to sea, as
though I could read in the distant mainland
beyond the horizon some hopes of a better fortune
and a life restored. Daily, as the time approached
for my case to be heard, as the second New Moon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
grew with every evening brighter in the last of
its crescent, I consulted officials of the Court. I
discovered it was customary to give each some
small sum of five or six dinars before they would
answer a question. It was upon the twelfth day,
the moon being nearly full, that the case before
mine (which turned upon whether a man without
means should owe for a debt or should postpone
payment, and had lasted five exciting days,) was
concluded. I heard that the precedent created was
of the first importance, but would be subject to
appeal.</p>

<p>“The sun sank. It was with the morrow that
my case was to be called.</p>

<p>“I rose on that eventful day long before dawn.
I put on my raiment with the utmost care, after
having cleansed it with my own hands to make it
as presentable as possible, lest the poverty of my
appearance should in some way prejudice me. I
had already given notice that I would appear
myself; for the fees asked by the Pleaders were
quite beyond the poor remnant of my purse. I
must confess that I had been strongly dissuaded
from such action, but I had no choice. I found a
great crowd assembled, for my name was familiar
to all through the position I had enjoyed in the
past; and it is ever of an absorbing interest to
watch the miseries of another.</p>

<p>“I took my seat at a place reserved for me
immediately opposite the bench. I noted on my
right the Pleaders chosen by the Council, and
beyond, among the spectators, not a few of my
former colleagues.</p>

<p>“The Pleaders were arranged in the vestments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
proper to their great function, resembling the
priests of a religion, and bearing upon their heads,
I noticed, what they never showed outside, a
strange headgear of mule skin with twisted hair
and long, furry ears. The Judge, I saw, was
clothed in the most magnificent cloth of gold,
inscribed with the sacred texts and loaded with
furs of such rare animals as the sacred Rat, the
white Jackal of Thibet, and the Skunk, and bore
upon his head a crown, which he lifted three times
as a salute to the Court, while all fell prostrate
before him, murmuring in a buzz of low, prayerful
whispers their praise and incantation to him as
the representative of God.</p>

<p>“These ceremonies concluded, there was a
bustle of men rising and taking their seats upon
the rugs of the court, the Judge himself upon a
sort of throne overlooking the whole, and the
proceedings began.</p>

<p>“A short man stood in front of the Judge’s
throne, who rose and piped in a shrill voice,
‘Mahmoud claims against the King.’ He then
sat down, and from sundry pushes and jerks
which I received from my friends, including the
Scrivener, who was kind enough to accompany me
to the Court, I saw that I was expected to rise
from my carpet and put my case.</p>

<p>“I said: ‘Your Holiness and Voice of God’
(for such is the formula required, as a kind friend
had warned me: and if one word be omitted the
culprit is not only forbidden to plead but is thrust
into a dungeon of the most noisome kind). ‘Your
Holiness,’ I opened, ‘and Voice of God. I had
from the King and his Councillors a Charter. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
was given me as against one million dinars paid
to them in gold by me on such and such a date. I
shall show the Charter to you, and you will see
there the promise that I am to receive, as against
the payment I made, the revenue from the Salt
Tax for ever and ever, so long as the State shall
endure and the tax be levied. This tax has been
in great part remitted, and by special imposts the
remaining part has been wiped out. I claim that
this Charter gives me the right to the original
revenue from the State in full.’ And I then
concluded with the magic formula with which
my friends had very kindly provided me, ‘<i>and
that, Divine One, is my case</i>.’ This formality
completed, I sat down.</p>

<p>“I flattered myself I had done well, for all had
been told with perfect ease, and, after all, there
was nothing more to be said. But before I took
my place, cross-legged upon my carpet, I handed
up to those who served the Bench my original of
the Charter, signed and sealed, the which I had
consulted. The Judge rose from the throne where
he was seated, put the Charter down carefully
upon his throne, sat upon it, and ordered the case
to proceed.</p>

<p>“In the chief of the Pleaders upon the other
side, I was pleased to see an old guest of mine.
He nodded to me familiarly, rose, and opened his
statement, beginning, as I did, with the ritual
phrase. ‘Your Holiness and Voice of God,’ said
he, ‘His Majesty and Council have instructed me.
I admit that this is a case of peculiar subtlety and
difficulty, nor do I doubt that it will employ many
of my colleagues, not only in this Court but in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
superior courts, for many months to come.
Indeed, to my certain knowledge, one of them has
recently purchased a marvellous vehicle which
travels rapidly of its own act without horses, a
foreign invention, in which he would not have
invested had he not foreseen the lengthy and
lucrative nature of the case. But that is by the
way. I only mention it in order to make Your
Holiness understand that we have here to settle
an issue which indeed could hardly have been
brought before any Judge less divine than
yourself.’</p>

<p>“There followed for about a quarter of an hour
a fine passage upon the majesty of the law and
the peculiar gifts and virtues of the Judges. But
through the whole of it he insisted in every second
sentence upon the gravity of the case and its
difficulty. I was flattered and surprised. I had
not thought that my opponents would make so
much of me; but, on the other hand, I remembered
that their payment was at the charge of the public
and that every day added to the sum they received.
He next touched upon the folly of the Salt Tax,
its iniquity, its old-fashionedness, its absurdity,
and after an hour of this paused a moment to
pull down and smooth the long furry ears of his
headgear.</p>

<p>“In the second hour he brought in the very
words of the Charter. He first recited them, ‘<i>for
ever and for ever, so long as the State shall
endure and the salt tax be paid</i>.’ He insisted,
with repeated emphasis, upon the word ‘<i>and</i>’. In
the third and fourth hours he quoted 150 instances
of cases in which this word had completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
changed the character of a document, as, for
instance, in the famous case known as Abraham’s
Will, where the testator left all his property to
his beloved wife, Fatimah, <i>and</i> the remainder to
her mother. Next, he quoted the case known as
the ‘Degree of Dignity,’ when it was ordered that
all those apprehended for speaking disrespectfully
of the Grand Mufti should be brought into his
presence <i>and</i> decapitated. Again (what interested
me very much, for it was connected with Money),
the terms of the statute, now over one hundred
years old, by which the Councillors of the King
receive one dinar per day <i>and</i> whatever other
sum they see fit to vote themselves out of the taxes.</p>

<p>“It was the word ‘<i>and</i>,’ said he, that made the
difference in all these cases. He might call
witnesses to show that the word was inserted in
the Charter to render the phrase abortive, absurd,
nonsensical and altogether of no effect. But,
alternatively, supposing that the word ‘<i>and</i>’ but
confirmed my case in the decision of His Holiness,
then he pleaded that the Charter, having been
obtained by a stranger, not a subject of the King,
was null and void. Supposing that it were upheld
in spite of this, then, alternatively, that I,
Mahmoud, was a subject of the King, a native
born, and therefore subject to the King’s decisions
in Council. Finally, he concluded that in any
case I must not win because, if I did, it would
make His Majesty’s Council and members
thereof look like a fool severally and collectively,
than which no more deplorable thing could happen
to the State. Further, even if His Holiness should
decide that it mattered not a rusty nail whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the Council were made to look fools or no, there
was, anyhow, no money to pay me. This established
a default contumax and a discharge in alias
of the second degree. I give his exact words, for
I noted them at the time, and could guess vaguely
that they must be of grave import. When he got
so far I noticed a great commotion among his
colleagues. Every man in court wore an expression
of strained attention mixed with admiration,
and the Judge himself could not withhold from
his august features something of the same tribute
to this Genius of Debate.</p>

<p>“‘Note also, Your Holiness,’ continued the
Pleader, wagging his arched forefinger (which
was long and pointed) very significantly in the
air, ‘the contumax in advert to subvert ... and
the same regardant.’ He added in a sort of sneering
tone: ‘I will not weary the Court with that’
(I could see that the Judge nodded), ‘but even
the plaintiff, learned as he is in the law, will
admit,’ and here he turned and addressed me with
a very contemptuous expression, ‘that plevin
would not obtain in the case of recognisance, or
at any rate in the defection thereof would be
docketed as an endorsement pursuant. An
endorsement pursuant would stand void,’ he
continued, with a renewed interest in his tone (he
now excited a feverish attention in his audience),
‘for that is in the very foundation, I take it, of
our law of terce and perinomy and has been
upheld by a long succession of your Holiness’s
predecessors from the origins of our Sacred
Lawyers’ Guild.’</p>

<p>“Here again I thought I noticed the trace of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
uncertain nod from the august figure upon the
bench. ‘It comes, therefore,’ concluded this
eloquent man, ‘in plain words, to this: we rely
on the terms general, and the reference particular,
each interconnected, and certainly maintain that
guaranty lies overt.’ Here he stopped dead, and
then added in simple and lower tones: ‘That is
my case.’ Then he sat down. I am told it was
one of the most marvellous efforts in all the
history of the Lawyers’ Guild.</p>

<p>“Applause may be permitted even in the
Mosque or the most sacred of Shrines, but not in
the august presence of the law. Yet it was with
difficulty that the enraptured pleaders present, the
scriveners and their attendants, could forbear
from open praise. A man whom I did not know
and who sat next to me, cross-legged, upon his
mat, one of the pleaders, I think (for he also wore
the mule skin with long, furry ears upon his head),
muttered to me that it was the finest opening he
had heard since Achmet had opened for the
Sheik-ul-Musrim in the Oyster Case, and that was
saying a great deal.</p>

<p>“When this great Pleader had sat down there
was a complete silence in court, which lasted for
some time and seemed to me a little embarrassing.
At last I perceived that I was in some way the
object of too much attention, and my friend the
Scrivener leant over with the suggestion that I
should call my witnesses. ‘But I have none,’
whispered I over my shoulder in great trepidation.
‘I have my Charter. That is enough, is it not?’</p>

<p>“The Scrivener shrugged his shoulders as
though in despair, and left me to my fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then was it that I heard the voice of the great
Judge booming into my ears. ‘What evidence is
there for the plaintiff?’</p>

<p>“I rose trembling. ‘I have given you all I have,
Your Holiness.’</p>

<p>“‘You have given me none,’ thundered that
tremendous personage. ‘All you have done is to
make an opening plea.’</p>

<p>“‘I thought,’ stammered I, ‘that I had stated all
that I had to state.’</p>

<p>“The Judge glanced round at his fellow lawyers
with a look of despair, then leaning forward, with
a sort of tenderness in his tone, he said: ‘Be good
enough to mount the Sacred Stool reserved for the
witnesses.’ With that a little block of wood was
brought forward, and upon it I mounted, and so
stood conscious and foolish before the Court.</p>

<p>“His Holiness the Judge leaned back on his
throne and surveyed me with the contempt I
deserved, nor did he repress the little titter that
ran through the assembly. An official squatted
in front of the throne put a scroll into my hand,
bade me put it to my forehead and repeat after
him certain words, the sense of which I lost in my
perturbation. But I did as I was bidden. After
that I remained dumb. ‘Well,’ said His Holiness,
sharply, after a long pause, ‘how much longer are
we to wait?’</p>

<p>“‘Pray, your Godship, what would you have?’
said I.</p>

<p>“‘I would have your evidence,’ said the Judge.</p>

<p>“‘I have no evidence to give,’ I tremblingly
replied, ‘save what you have already heard.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘I have heard none,’ said he, and again the
titter went round the court.</p>

<p>“Moved to action, I repeated exactly what I had
said before, that the words were what they were
in the Charter, the clause was what it was. I
repeated it point by point.</p>

<p>“The Judge turned to the Pleader who had just
sat down and said: ‘Now, brother Selim,’ whereupon
my former friend and guest rose, looked me
up and down in a very offensive manner from head
to foot three or four times, and cried:</p>

<p>“‘You drunken scoundrel! Do you still maintain
the abominable falsehood which you have had
the insolence to lay before the Court?’</p>

<p>“I said there was no falsehood, but the truth.</p>

<p>“‘The truth!’ he sneered. ‘Remember, pray,
that you have taken an oath in the name of the
Scroll, and trivial as this may seem to a man of
your depraved character, others take the matter
more seriously.’</p>

<p>“I stood silent under the rebuke and waited his
further words.</p>

<p>“‘Well, well,’ said he suddenly, ‘where were
you half an hour after sunrise on the fourth day
of the Fast of Ramadan in the three hundred and
seventh year from the Flight of the Prophet?’</p>

<p>“As I stood aghast at the question, he touched
one hand significantly with the finger of the other
and said, ‘I do not wish to press you.’</p>

<p>“‘I have not the least idea,’ said I.</p>

<p>“The Pleader glanced significantly at the Judge
and then continued:</p>

<p>“‘You haven’t the least idea? Can you tell me
approximately where you were?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘No, I cannot,’ said I. ‘It is very long ago,
and I was but a young and innocent child.’</p>

<p>“Here the Judge interrupted me sharply: ‘We
are not concerned with your young and innocent
childhood. Answer the question, if you please,
and make no speeches.’</p>

<p>“The Pleader consulted his notes, looked up to
me again and said: ‘You have told us the Charter
was signed in your presence and delivered over
to you.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t answer,’ interrupted His Holiness,
sharply, ‘until you are asked a question.’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘Take great care, witness,’ said His Holiness
in a menacing voice. ‘Take very great care!’</p>

<p>“‘Thank You, your Holiness,’ said the Pleader.
‘And now, sir,’ said he, addressing me in a very
firm tone indeed, as though he had caught red-handed
some thief creeping in to his household,
‘will you please tell us where is that Charter now?
Can you produce it?’</p>

<p>“‘His Holiness is sitting on it,’ said I, simply.</p>

<p>“Here the Judge almost rose from his throne,
so strongly was he moved.</p>

<p>“‘Were you not a layman and naturally ignorant
of the forms of the Court, I should condemn
you to some very severe penalty,’ said he. ‘I
make allowance for your lack of custom; but I
warn you, you may go too far.’</p>

<p>“‘I will pass over the last remark, witness,’
continued the Pleader in dignified tones. ‘I think
you were not quite yourself when you made it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Will you be good enough to answer my question?
Where is the Charter now?’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said I, all bewildered, ‘I handed it up
for His Holiness to see what my case was, and to
the best of my belief he——’</p>

<p>“‘Silence,’ thundered the Judge. ‘Brother
Selim, I am afraid we shall get no further on this
tack. The witness evidently does not or will not
understand your drift. Allow me to ask him a
question.’ He then turned with a sort of false
kindness upon his face and said to me in measured
tones: ‘What we want to know is, where is the
Charter upon which you claim?’</p>

<p>“‘I put it into Court ...’ I began.</p>

<p>“At this the Judge gave a little gesture of
despair and sighed. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>“‘It is a principle of the law of this country,’
said His Holiness, leaning back in apparent weariness
as though he were instructing a child, ‘I
should have thought a principle known even to the
meanest of His Majesty’s subjects, that a document
must be proved. Have you proved the
Charter of which you speak?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know what you mean, Your Holiness,’
said I, in very genuine fear.</p>

<p>“The Judge leaned forward towards me and
said in measured tones: ‘Remember that I am
treating you leniently. I am doing what I can for
you, I understand the difficulty of your position.
Take care! Take very great care! Brother Selim,
have you any other questions to ask?’</p>

<p>“‘I have one or two of some consequence, if I
may be allowed, Your Holiness?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Certainly, brother Selim. Pray continue. We
are all ears.’</p>

<p>“The Pleader cleared his throat, again consulted
his notes, looked up to me and said: ‘What
were your earnings in games of hazard during the
year concluding with the opening of the last Feast
of Ramadan?’</p>

<p>“I answered that I had no exact calculation, but
that I had small stomach for such pastimes, and
might have won or lost anything between one
hundred and two hundred dinars.</p>

<p>“‘Take care, take very great care!’ said His
Holiness, addressing me again.</p>

<p>“‘Between one or two hundred dinars,’ said the
Pleader, in a musing sort of voice, and I noticed
that the Judge was taking a note of my reply.
‘Now be good enough, you base fellow, to answer
me this—and remember you are upon your oath—have
you been in the habit of cheating at cards,
loading dice, stacking packs, palming coins, and
in other ways overreaching those who joined
you in what they thought to be an innocent
amusement?’</p>

<p>“I was about to reply when he again thundered
at me: ‘Remember you are upon your oath,’ and
His Holiness was moved to add:</p>

<p>“‘Take care, witness, take very great care!’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said I.</p>

<p>“At this moment I was astonished to see everybody,
including the Pleader, sit down suddenly,
cross-legged, upon the floor, while I stood there
upon my little block of wood, most terribly
conspicuous. It was due to a gesture from the
Judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘So far,’ said he, in a solemn and majestic
manner, ‘I have allowed things to take their
course, because, as I have said, every latitude must
be allowed to one who is foolish enough to plead
his own case. But the dignity of His Majesty’s
Court forbids me to be silent upon hearing this
last reply to a question of the most profound and
searching kind, requiring an adequate reply. The
witness has insolently answered “No”.’ He then
turned to me and said, with a severity that thrilled
me to the marrow: ‘This is a Civil Court; but
remember, sir,’ and here he raised his voice in a
very terrible manner, ‘I can impound documents
and present all that you have said to the Lord
Prosecutor.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, Your Holiness,’ said I, now thoroughly
at sea.</p>

<p>“‘Proceed,’ said the Judge, simply, to the
Pleader.</p>

<p>“‘I have only one more question to ask,’ said
the Pleader.</p>

<p>“‘Proceed, proceed, brother Selim,’ said the
Judge with geniality.</p>

<p>“‘Do you or do you not suffer from the itch?’</p>

<p>“‘My lord,’ said I, ‘am I really to reply to——’</p>

<p>“His Holiness interrupted me with a violence
which I little expected from one in so exalted a
position. ‘Answer the question!’ he shouted,
‘answer the question at once!’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said I, ‘to tell the truth, I have some
little affection of the sole of my left foot, but I
conceive that with careful attention and proper
medical advice——’</p>

<p>“‘That will do,’ said the Pleader, putting up his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
hand. ‘We have heard all we need to hear,’ and
he sat down again upon his mat.</p>

<p>“‘Any rebulgence?’ said His Holiness, looking
round with a pleasant smile upon all assembled.</p>

<p>“I had no idea what was meant, but my friend
the Scrivener passed me up a little note, saying,
‘Do you carefully re-examine yourself so as to
undo the effect of this terrible cross-examination.’</p>

<p>“It was all Greek to me, but grasping at a straw
I addressed His Holiness, and said:</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Voice of God and Justice upon earth! I
would like to ask myself certain questions.’</p>

<p>“‘By all means,’ said he graciously. ‘Let me
inform you what is the custom of the Court. You
have first to stand and ask yourself the question;
you shall then stand up again and reply to it.’</p>

<p>“Kneeling, I struck the pavement of the court
three times with my forehead as is the custom, and
rising again turned towards the empty space upon
the little block of wood and said:</p>

<p>“‘Now, witness, remember you are upon your
oath; did you or did you not receive the Charter
from the King and his Council in the terms you
have mentioned?’</p>

<p>“I then leapt upon the little block of wood and
turning to the place I had just occupied, I said:</p>

<p>“‘I did.’</p>

<p>“I then jumped down again (luckily I was still
a young man and the exercise did not affect me or
cause me loss of breath) and I asked:</p>

<p>“‘What did you do with that document?’</p>

<p>“I leapt upon the little block of wood again and
turned to the place I had just occupied and
answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘I brought it into court.’</p>

<p>“Once more did I take up my place on the floor,
standing beneath the little block of wood.</p>

<p>“‘Having brought it into court, what did you
do with it?’</p>

<p>“I returned to my little block of wood, faced the
place I had just occupied and said:</p>

<p>“‘I handed it up to His Holiness.’</p>

<p>“The Judge then spoke. ‘I have had enough
of this and I refuse to waste the time of the Court
longer. It is in my power to condemn you to the
King’s dungeons for ever, and I may say that
never in my long experience of our august Courts
have I come across anything to parallel your
repeated insolence. I have already told you that
you have not proved your document and therefore
for the purposes of this Court it does not exist.
Stand down.’</p>

<p>“The words ‘stand down’ signify in the technical
language of this great people ‘sit down,’ and
can only be disobeyed under the most fearful
penalties. I at once obeyed and resumed my place
cross-legged upon the mat.</p>

<p>“The Judge was now free to give his decision,
but first he turned to the Pleader who had opposed
me and said in the most genial tones:</p>

<p>“‘Brother Selim, you have, I take it, proved
your document, especially the word “and”?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, yes, my lord,’ answered he, in a satisfied
manner. ‘I have further interpleaded for secondary
and excised the four principal terminants,
all of which are duly stamped, passed, filed,
recorded, exuded, denoted, permuted, polluted
and redeemed.’ To each of these words the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
Judge nodded with greater and greater content,
and then asked:</p>

<p>“‘Do you call any further witnesses, brother
Selim?’</p>

<p>“‘I call none,’ replied the eminent man, ‘for if
I do the vile plaintiff would have an opportunity
of cross-examining them and that would give away
my whole case.’</p>

<p>“‘I think you have done wisely,’ said His Holiness,
by way of an obiter dictum. ‘Things shall
therefore turn upon the Charter alone.’ With
these words I perceived by the rustle all about me
that the last phase of the trial had come and that
my fate was sealed. I thought I had observed in
the manner of its conduct I will not say a bias, but
a sort of atmosphere unfavourable to my claims;
for though it was impossible to conceive that any
personal or other feeling could affect His Holiness’s
mind, yet I dreaded his decision. None the
less I awaited that decision with some interest,
for, after all, nothing is certain until it is concluded.</p>

<p>“The judge put down his crown, assumed a
headgear which resembled that of the Special
Pleaders but gilded, and with the interior of the
long furry ears carefully painted in silver by way
of contrast; for such the Custom of the Law
demands when a decision is about to be delivered.</p>

<p>“He spoke:</p>

<p>“‘From the evidence that has been laid before
me it is clear that there exists, or has existed, will
exist, or may exist, or can exist or at some other
time existed, demurrer notwithstanding, some
Charter wherein the word <small>AND</small> is the point at issue.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
That form was admitted by the defence, I think?’
All the Pleaders rose and bowed and then again
were seated upon their carpets. ‘But I gather’
(and here he looked sternly at me) ‘that there was
no acceptance by the Plaintiff. We have, I take it,
an operative clause wherein the operative word
is <small>AND</small>. “<span class="smcap">And</span> so long as the salt tax endures.”
Many points brought forward in defence of the
Crown I am compelled to overlook. It is the glory
of our courts of justice that they exercise an
absolutely even-handed dealing between man and
man, and that His Majesty himself is bound by
their decisions.’ (Here there was a murmur of
applause which was instantly suppressed.) ‘I
make therefore so bold as to say that the Counsel
engaged by his Majesty on this occasion have
said many things with which I do not agree and
others which I shall not take into account. It is
equally clear that the case presented by the Plaintiff
is, as he put it, no case at all, and that were I
to rely, as I shall not, upon the strict forms of
law, he is already out of Court.’ At this all looked
severely on me and I felt my stature singularly
diminished, and crouched lower upon my mat.
His Holiness continued:</p>

<p>“‘I shall treat this matter as though I had
heard no pleadings upon either side, for this I
take to be the true attitude of a judge concerned
with justice alone. We have, then, this operative
“<small>AND</small> ...” this decisive word “<small>AND</small>.”’ Here
His Holiness leaned back on his throne, cast his
eyes upwards towards the rich arabesques of the
ceiling, sighed and continued:</p>

<p>“‘The word <small>AND</small> is among the most significant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of our ancient, glorious language. It has been
used upon innumerable occasions. Our industrial
classes, our nobility and even our middle classes,
as well as the poor in their humble station, are
compelled to its continual expression. It is, if
I may so express myself, part of the heritage of
our race. He would indeed be poor in spirit, and
weak in his allegiance to the imperial traditions
of this island,’ continued His Holiness, warming
to his subject, ‘did he not appreciate the majesty,
the significance, the grandeur upon occasions, the
full effect and indeed the awful weight of this
little word,’ and here he dropped his voice, <small>AND</small>
‘“<span class="smcap">And</span> so long as the salt tax ...” etc. That is
the point. <span class="smcap">And</span> ... I trust I have made myself
clear.’</p>

<p>“All heads nodded in unison, while a song in
adoration of His Holiness was sung by an acolyte
who entered at this stage of the proceedings (as
is customary in courts of law), and a hidden chorus,
distant, but just heard, added a short canticle of
praise. His Holiness waited for the conclusion of
these ceremonies, which are invariably interpolated
during any important judgment, and then
continued:</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">And</span> so long,’ ‘What is the significance of
that word “<small>AND</small>”? I take it that it is affirmative,
negative, copulative and restrictive; but that is—not
all. I think it is also constructive, instructive,
and destructive. It is only by using it in all these
ways that we can fully appreciate its preponderant
significance in the issue before us.’ Once
more all heads nodded and even I was constrained
to follow the custom, although, in my ignorance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
I could make neither head nor tail of the learned
argument. The lawyers present bore a look of
such intense absorption that one would have
thought their lives depended on what was to
come.</p>

<p>“‘The Plaintiff in reciting the clause,’ said His
Holiness quite suddenly, ‘emphasized a very
singular phrase “for ever and for ever,” and also
those other words, “so long as the state endures,”
but I noticed a curious hesitation upon his part
when he came to this word <small>AND</small>.’</p>

<p>“Here some one in the back of the court
yawned in so audible a manner that there was a
sudden interruption signalling an ejection, and
I learned later that the unfortunate man had
perished as he deserved.</p>

<p>“‘I appreciate fully,’ continued the Judge,
‘that my decision will, subject to appeal, determine
in great part the future of this ancient State.
Since we are destined soon to acquire and administer
the whole world it may be said that my
humble remarks upon this occasion will deflect the
history of the human race itself. No one can be
insensitive to such a responsibility. My duty is
clear. The word “<small>AND</small>,” standing as it does
between the first and second parts of the phrase
on which is based Plaintiff’s claim under the
Charter, clearly determines that claim. But to
determine is to terminate. The Plaintiff has
therefore no rights here, in the sense of the word
“rights” as used by the august body of our
Statute and Common Law. He is at the mercy of
the Crown, and his claim is disallowed. He may
think himself lucky that I have not taken ad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>vantage
of my full powers and had him whipped
at the cart’s tail or thrown down a well. Let
record be made and all adjudged as decided.’
With this His Holiness majestically rose, granted
a benediction to the kneeling multitude, and was
about to leave the Court when the Pleader Selim
interrupted with the words:</p>

<p>“‘What about costs, your Godship?’</p>

<p>“‘With the Judgment,’ said the judge wearily
over his shoulder; and I noticed to my dismay
ten pens busily scribbling and wondered what
was coming next.</p>

<p>“Indeed I was weary of the whole affair and
desired nothing better than to hide my humble
head in my poor lodging and on the morrow with
what was left of my poor little hoard—at the
most 400 dinars—to leave for the mainland, and
there with this tiny capital attempt to reconstruct
my fortunes.</p>

<p>“It was not to be as I imagined. Even as I
approached the door of the Court I was approached
by the Pleader Selim, who repeated
that phrase hitherto meaningless, ‘What about
costs?’ and found I might not depart from the
building till I had provided 350 dinars, leaving
me with exactly fifty to face the world! Luckily
I had my pouch upon me. I hurriedly counted
out this last poor remainder of my wealth; then,
fearing to return to my lodging (the rent of which
I could no longer discharge) I paced hopelessly
along the quays through the evening and on
through the darkness, until, about midnight, I
espied a master mariner about to board his
vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘For what sum,’ I asked him, ‘will you take
me on deck to the mainland?’</p>

<p>“‘It is a hundred dinars,’ he said roughly.</p>

<p>“‘I have it not,’ I answered. My stomach was
already clamouring for food. ‘I have but fifty
dinars, and some part of that I must reserve for
my nourishment lest I perish before reaching
land.’</p>

<p>“‘Well,’ said he a little less roughly but with
no humanity in his tone, ‘you may crawl up forward
among the cordage if you like and give me
forty-five of your coins; the five you shall keep
to feed yourself with when you land.’</p>

<p>“I thanked him humbly for his unexpected
kindness. I tried to find some warmth in the
chilly night, huddled amid coils of rope on the
little deck forward. At dawn the last of the
crew came aboard, two great sails were hoisted
and we passed out upon the sea.</p>

<p>“Before the sun was high we had dropped over
the horizon, and left behind us the palaces of the
land where I had thought to find security and
repose. There I was, I who had so lately had the
world at my disposal, a beggar, hopeless for the
coming days, and wondering where on my landing
I should find food to keep me living for a
week together.”</p>

<p>As Mahmoud was concluding there rose a loud
wail, piercing and prolonged which startled him
and all the file of boys aligned cross-legged before
him upon the floor. It proceeded from the
youngest of the nephews.</p>

<p>“What is it, my little fellow?” said his uncle
in real alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! Ah!” sobbed out the poor infant. “Lost!
lost! All lost! All that lovely money lost! I
cannot bear it, uncle. I cannot bear it!” and he
burst into floods of tears.</p>

<p>“For heaven’s sake,” said the old man, rolling
upon his seat in his concern for the child, “do
not take on so! There is no cause for such a
bother. You make too much of it. It is but part
of a tale. Do you not see how I have been restored
to great fortune? Are you not in this palace of
mine with all my slaves around you? and splendid
hangings upon the wall? Come, look about you
and do not mix up these words of the past with
real things that you can touch and see to-day.”</p>

<p>The little boy tried to stifle his sobs, but they
returned with increased violence.</p>

<p>“Oh, uncle, to think that you, who had been
so rich, should become so poor; to think that
those who gain great wealth cannot keep it for
ever! Consider all your wealth! Oh, it is terrible,
the death and destruction of it!” Throwing himself
down upon the marble floor he buried his face
in his crossed arms and kicked either foot alternately
in the air, in the violent paroxysm of his
grief.</p>

<p>His uncle was so moved that he knelt beside the
child to soothe him.</p>

<p>“Pray, pray, restrain yourself,” he said. “You
will do yourself some hurt. I admire you, my
dear boy, I perceive your singular gifts. More
than all your elder brothers do you seem to know
that which the young should seek in life. You
understand indeed what others do not always,
all that money means. But it is terrible to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
one of your age suffering such agonies from a
mere recital of its loss. Indeed, I am moved to
console you,” here the old man was tempted to
put his hand into his pouch and offer some small
coin in consolation to the child, but he recollected
himself and continued, “to console you with a
pleasant draft of cold water, which I am afraid
I forgot to tender to you and your brothers when
I last had the pleasure of your attendance.”</p>

<p>The little fellow sat up, still sobbing, but
attempting to dry his eyes and moaning from
time to time “All that money! All that lovely
money!”</p>

<p>Pure, cold, crystal water was brought round
and gratefully sipped by the boys, who when
they had thus refreshed themselves at their
uncle’s expense, thanked him warmly and disappeared
with reverence from his presence just at
the moment when the voice of the Muezzin was
heard from a neighbouring minaret boring the
Faithful to tears with its repeated call to prayer.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">As</span>
Mahmoud’s nephews filed in just after the
hour of public executions to hear the continuation
of their uncle’s absorbing tale, they
wore an expression different from that which he
had observed on their faces during so many days.
The thought of this great man subjected to misfortune
like any other, and passing through the
trials of actual poverty, had shocked their young
and sensitive souls. They had been trained
indeed, even in their short experience, to the
idea that they and their poor father must suffer
contempt; but that the head of the family should
ever have passed through such things shook their
faith in the world.</p>

<p>The aged merchant, a little concerned with
their appearance, warned them that what he had
to tell them, not only upon that day but later too,
would be concerned with no happy relation.
“These were, my children,” said he, “the days of
my dereliction. They served to humble me, and
often when I have occasion to turn a poor man
out of his house or to prosecute some starving
widow for debt, or to see to the imprisonment
of one who has failed to keep some contract I
may have imposed upon him, I sigh and chasten
myself with the thought that I myself might (but
for the infinite goodness of my God) have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
in his or her position. Though, frankly, I cannot
say, considering the ineptitude of such people,
that I can ever imagine them in mine.” Having
so prefaced what he had to tell, the merchant
proceeded:</p>

<p>“I sat down, then, in the bows of the boat on
that miserable night watching for land. I tried
to make some plan, as is the habit of men of my
temper, but none would form itself in my fatigued
and unhappy brain. One asset I had and one only
(over and above the few coins which could hardly
last me for more than a day) and that was the
dress I wore; for I still carried the fine clothes
of my former rank. I had worn them on the
occasion of the trial; indeed, I now had no others.</p>

<p>“This accoutrement and a certain proud manner
of bearing which I had acquired during the
past years of my affluence saved me from insult;
though I am not sure that if I had been asked
to carry some package for the wealthier of the
passengers I should not have accepted the opportunity
of reward. I spent about half my poor
handful of cash on a meal; with the remainder
I purchased provision for the evening.</p>

<p>“The town in which I found myself was—happily—too
busy and populous a mart to pay
attention to a chance wanderer. Lacking all
direction, trusting as I had trusted long ago to
fortune or rather to Providence, I betook myself
after the worst heat of the day had passed, to a
chance track which led first along the river side,
above the harbour, and afterwards climbed
through the gardens of the city to the hills beyond.</p>

<p>“The countryside was here of a nature more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
fertile than the countries through which I had
hitherto passed. The dense trees of the woods
made a grateful shade for me in that silent afternoon,
and when I had passed beyond these on my
upward journey I came to a great rolling land of
sparse grass, feed for cattle.</p>

<p>“It was hired out, it would seem, to graziers;
for I saw some little way off standing in the
attitude of a shepherd and holding his bent staff
beside his vigorous old frame, a very remarkable
figure. I approached him without any set idea
of what my adventure might lead to. I only
knew that things could not be worse. Perhaps
I had somewhere in my mind a guess, half-formed,
that I could be of some service at some small
wage. At any rate I accosted him. I have
seldom seen an expression more haughty and
vigorous and marvelled that it should be that of
a hired man. He was perhaps sixty years of age
with a strong bearing, eyes luminous and almost
fierce, and a face in outline that of a hawk, or
better, that of an eagle. And as he stood there he
watched, grazing before him, a great flock of
sheep, well fed, and fat; of a high breed, excellent
to behold. There were at least a thousand of
these and it would seem that the religion of this
part (for they also were true believers) did not
forbid the use of bells. For I heard a multitudinous
tinkling come up from the flock as it
moved. Very far away the plateau made an edge
against the sky, and between that horizon and the
summit to which I had reached, folds, with water
pools concealed in them, diversified the great
sweep. But there were no trees. All was bare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and majestic under the sky as the light melted
towards evening.</p>

<p>“The shepherd returned my salutation, accepted
my offer to share the very scanty food which I had
purchased and so sat down before me on the
ground to eat.</p>

<p>“As we ate we grew acquainted. I told him
frankly enough of my misfortune, though not in
detail. ‘I was,’ said I, ‘only the day before yesterday
a rich man. To-day I am what you see,
and my last piece of silver is gone.’ He looked
at me gravely and said that there was One Who
gave and Who took away. His Name be exalted.
‘These sheep, for instance,’ said he, ‘are the property
of a man contemptible in every way, foolish,
irascible, a bad master and (one would have
thought) an unwise merchant. Yet he prospers
while I, the shepherd, remain upon a hire too
small to permit me to save. And so it has been
for years!’</p>

<p>“‘I have not,’ added he a little bitterly, ‘the
faculties for that sort of life which my master
pursues. At any rate I am quite certain of this:
that by any common judgment of men he is the
inferior and I the lord. Yet here I am!... The
world deals harshly by poor men.’ He looked at
me to see if the words sank in.</p>

<p>“As he thus spoke (his sadness seemed to relieve
my own with a sense of our common dependence)
the sun now near the horizon warned us
of prayer and I was glad indeed to see that this
new chance companion was as much alive as I
to the duties we owe our Maker. He fell upon his
knees and bowed to the evening prayer as I did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
beside him, and for some moments, as we recited
the sacred formula, all worldly thoughts passed
from my mind and I think from his also. We
rose at the same moment from this exercise, each
filled, I felt, with brotherhood. I was the first
to break the consecrated silence.</p>

<p>“I did so by asking him whether he had never
thought, in the course of his long years as a
shepherd, how money might be made by the
stealing of his master’s sheep, or by some
trick with them? Whether he had never
had the opportunity to blackmail his master,
or in some other way to increase his
fortune? For it seemed intolerable to me that a
man such as he described his employer to be,
should be wealthy while he were poor. He
shrugged his shoulders as though in despair and
answered simply:</p>

<p>“‘In the distant past I often attempted such
things; but invariably have I failed. Indeed, the
master graziers of this part know me well for one
who has attempted at their expense every kind of
bold chance, and I would never have employment
from them were it not for my skill in lambing and
in every other part of the trade. As it is they
watch me rigorously. Their spies are everywhere.
I could not, I fear, make one dinar by any one of
the methods you suggest. I have in my time tried
them all. I have forged receipts; I have sold
sheep which afterwards I entered as dead from
accident; I have falsified the returns of the lambing;
I have sometimes raised a sum of money
upon the flock under pretence that it was my own.
My only reward has been fine and imprisonment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and cruel torture. But the truth is that I have
not the faculties of the merchant. They are, I
take it, granted to some and withheld from others.
For my part I have despaired of their exercise
and shall never turn to them again.’</p>

<p>“His words filled me at once with pity and with
hope, and (since ingenuity is never long absent
from men of my temper) a scheme suddenly
appeared.</p>

<p>“‘Why should not we,’ I said, after I had
gathered wood and lit a fire to meet the approaching
darkness, ‘enter into partnership? I think I
may say without boasting that I possess in a
singular degree those faculties which you say you
lack. God made me in every part for a merchant.
I can conceal, distort, forestall, outdo, bully,
terrify and even boldly snatch, far better than any
other man I have come across. Only once in my
life have I fallen into the weakness of trusting
others and as you see I have paid bitterly for that
weakness.’ So I spoke, not noticing that I was
yet again committing the same error in suggesting
partnership to a mere stranger. But in truth
Allah had blinded me; purposing to make me taste
misfortune to the full that I might the better
adore His later beneficence.</p>

<p>“‘All these talents I have in abundance and
more also,’ I continued, ‘for God has been very
good to me. You, on the other hand, have what I
lack; that is, a knowledge of the towns round about
and of their markets; of the value of sheep; of the
system which has been organized for the catching
of ingenious men; and of how that system may be
avoided. Between us, then, we have all the things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
needed for our success. Come, let us determine
with the very next breaking of the light to try our
fortunes together.’</p>

<p>“After I had thus spoken the shepherd looked at
me long and anxiously over the fire, the reflection
of which shone in his piercing eyes. I wondered
whether he were wavering and to what conclusion
he would come. At last he spoke, slowly enough.</p>

<p>“‘I am not willing,’ said he, ‘I am not willing
... but I will take the risk. The worst that can
come to me I have already suffered. At the best’—and
he pointed towards the vast flock of sheep
now a mass of glimmering white as they lay in the
darkness—‘at the best we should each acquire
provision for many years.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh! fool!’ thought I, ‘provision for many
years! Does he not know how money breeds?’
But in open speech I said, ‘Yes, we will divide the
spoil and go our ways. I with my share and you
with yours.’</p>

<p>“‘Precisely,’ he answered with a curious smile
which, for the moment, intrigued me. ‘You with
your share and I with mine.’</p>

<p>“As the night passed I entertained him with
the details of my plan. Since it was I who had
to do the work while he would have to command
(from his knowledge of the trade), I proposed
that he should be the master and I the man. To
all this he nodded assent. He was also prepared
to meet me in my suggestion that he should put
on my fine clothes and I his rags, the better to
carry out our parts. ‘This will,’ said I, ‘seem
strange while you are driving the sheep, but as
we approach the town and market to which you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
shall direct me, if there be one nearby, I will
attempt to take over your task and under your
direction I may at least complete it by bringing
the flock to the place of sale. I will speak of
you as the owner. My fine dress which you wear
will carry out that deception and deceive all into
thinking that it is an honest transaction. The sum
upon which we shall agree with the purchaser shall
be paid to <i>you</i>; and not until the whole transaction
is over, and we well out of the gate, shall I
ask for the division, which I take it should be in
equal halves.’</p>

<p>“To all this also he agreed; only asking whether
I would not like (as, after all, I had only just met
him) to have the money paid to both?</p>

<p>“I urged him to keep to my plan. His receiving
the money as master would seem natural and
excite no surprise. We could divide in private at
our leisure.</p>

<p>“To my surprise he made me a low bow at this;
but I put it down to custom, and went on with
my plan.</p>

<p>“For the sake of a rough calculation I asked
him what sheep were fetching, and he said that
in the neighbouring Ksar, which might be called
a straggling market town or a large village, there
was to be held, it so happened, the very next day
a sheep market, where we must find ourselves
shortly after sunrise. It was distant less than an
hour across the uplands. The purchasers came
from all parts, and as the bidding was likely to
be brisk we might expect for the flock as a whole
not less than 1,800 or even 2,000 pieces of gold.
As he spoke I already felt that capital in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
possession, or, at least, half of it, and I thought
things would go hard with me if after our first
successful transaction I could not carry on my
partner to another and another, until at last I
had manipulated him out of his share also.</p>

<p>“We discussed all further details through the
night, rehearsed our parts, and had the whole perfect
when the first glimmer of dawn showed in the
East beyond the edges of the hills beneath a waning
moon.</p>

<p>“We rose; the flock was gathered; our garments
exchanged; and I could not but admire my
companion, now that he was dressed in what
seemed a manner so much more suitable to his carriage
and features. He looked a very Master, a
prosperous lord of men, and I congratulated him
upon the effect, which, I assured him would allay
all suspicion, since all would take him for a very
great lord indeed.</p>

<p>“Again he smiled that intriguing smile and
bowed too low. But I was a little nettled at his
affecting to play the part thoroughly by addressing
me in sharp tones and with the air of a
superior. I, for my part, shivered in the dawn in
the miserable rags which I had taken from him,
and holding his staff awkwardly enough tramped
on in my character of the servant.</p>

<p>“Soon, just as the sun rose, the dusty hedges
and the cracked yellowish walls of the Ksar appeared
in a hollow through which ran a muddy
stream. From the enclosures within, rose the
bleating of many sheep which had been driven to
the same market, and we observed upon the folds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
of land beyond several flocks arriving in convergence
upon the same place.</p>

<p>“My companion told me while we were still out
of earshot that an early arrival would allow us
to watch the movement of prices and, what was of
more value to us, might enable us to get away
before opportunity for pursuit should arise.</p>

<p>“He gave me my last instructions, recalling
all that we had arranged in the night. ‘I, for my
part,’ said he, as the first sheep of our great flock
entered the narrow streets, ‘shall fall behind you
and take my way to the Pavement outside the
Mosque reserved for the principal merchants, and
there with all due dignity and honour await your
report, while you go forward to the market place
beyond the Mosque: when you have got a purchaser,
come back and find me. For such is here
the custom. It is the servant who negotiates, the
master who confirms. The servant leads the purchaser
to his superior, and that superior takes the
purchase money. Do you, for your part, cast
around until you hear the conversation of the bidders
and see that you sell at a price not less than
2,000 pieces of gold.’ He then gave the number
of our flock all told, which he made me repeat
to a single point in ewes and in lambs. When he
had said this he fell behind me and went up a
street which led to the Mosque; while I, in some
doubt of my capacity, but putting what bold face
I could upon the matter, went straight before me
along the broad way toward the market beyond.
There I drove all the flock into a great pen, of
which certain were reserved for the vendors in
that mart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>“The market soon filled with buyers. They
came in little groups, prodding the sheep, feeling
the wool and sometimes looking into their mouths;
and the flock which I had the honour of commanding
was the most admired of all. I was
asked by several if I would not sell singly; but
estimating the eagerness of the buyers I shook
my head and said I could not sell for less than a
reserve sum of two thousand pieces of gold, nor
could I break the flock. I added that it was a pity
to do so as it was a pedigree flock, every single
animal being descended from the famous ram
which had spoken in a human voice to the Holy
Hassan three hundred years ago by order of the
Most High. I admitted that this origin made little
difference to the mutton, but I pointed out its
extraordinary effect upon the wool.</p>

<p>“With that the bidding began and I noticed with
great pleasure one tall, dark, very thin man among
the rest, slow of gesture, fixed of eye, who never
took his looks from my face and who, just after
each last bid, would raise it by fifty pieces of gold.
He was not to be beaten. One competitor after
another dropped out. At last when the magnificent
sum of 2,832 pieces of gold had been bid by
the mysterious stranger I clapped my hands
together as the signal and used the formula
‘Heaven has decided.’ The stranger approached
me, drawing from his girdle a reed and a small
horn of ink. I thought we were about to sign
the transfer—it seemed to me an odd formality,
seeing that he had but to drive the beasts away
and leave me the bag of gold. I was undeceived.
He presented me no charter of transfer, no deed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
but a strange piece of writing such as I had not
seen before and asked me for its counterpart. I
was startled and a little confused. ‘What counterpart?’
said I.</p>

<p>“‘Do you mean,’ said he in clear tones, so that
the curious bystanders should overhear, ‘that you
have no permit?’</p>

<p>“At this the audience tittered, and others, scenting
amusement, crowded round to gaze and follow.</p>

<p>“‘Have you no permit?’ he repeated severely.</p>

<p>“I felt myself growing hot and confused under
the laughter which followed; and even alarmed
when I heard one buyer say contemptuously to his
neighbour, ‘They’ve caught another of ’em!’</p>

<p>“I confessed that I had never even heard of
such an instrument.</p>

<p>“‘Follow me,’ said the stranger grimly, and
whether from curiosity or from a conviction growing
in me that he had authority, I followed
humbly enough, leaving my large flock bleating in
its pen.</p>

<p>“The stranger (for he now showed that he had
upon him the keys of the market) locked the gate
of the pen, appointed (another proof of his
authority) a slave to stand by and see that no one
interfered with the property I had transferred to
him, and motioned to others to fall in behind us.
He then led me away, and I was more concerned
than ever to notice the strange smiles of those who
saw the little procession which we made, he going
first with his great staff, I treading behind.</p>

<p>“He led me to where the Sheiks of the neighbourhood,
the principal sheep owners and magistrates,
sat in solemnity before the Mosque; an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
awe-inspiring company. Grand and splendid
among them, in their very centre and clearly the
most revered of them all, I perceived my late companion
the shepherd, all dressed up in my own
fine clothes, but having now added ornaments reserved
for him, and looking for all the world like
the king of the place.</p>

<p>“At our approach he turned an indignant glance
upon me, rose to his feet, and addressing the
stranger who had captured me, cried in a terrible
voice:</p>

<p>“‘Officer! Do you bring me yet another of
these evildoers? Whose sheep had he driven off?
And is it a case of a forged permit or what?’</p>

<p>“I already saw how the land lay, and I quailed
to think what was before me. The owners—I
rightly guessed—had suffered from sheep stealing;
had established permits, signed by them, in
order to check fraudulent sales; had plotted to
catch the thief culprits, and this perfidious man
had disguised himself as a servant in order to
catch such, and had caught <i>me</i>. The officer who
had arrested me spoke:</p>

<p>“‘My lord,’ he said, ‘we have caught this
ruffian’—pointing to me—‘selling <i>your</i> sheep without
any permit at all! He must have driven them
through the night. By the law which your Council
proclaimed last year, just after the Fast, his punishment
lies in your hands. The owner has the
determination of it.’</p>

<p>“To my astonishment and horror my former
companion looked on me with a dreadful face of
scorn and said: ‘Tell me all, that I may apportion
the punishment due to him. I had had him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
in my employ for but a short time. I mistrusted
him from the first. Tell me all!’</p>

<p>“‘I have so found him selling your lordship’s
sheep. They fetched nearly 3,000 pieces of gold,’
answered the officer grimly. ‘He shall make an
excellent example for, my lord, he is the first
whom we have caught in this market trying to
sell without a permit. There can be no doubt (I
have witnesses to it) that he proposed to take the
purchase money and (perhaps with some accomplice
whom I have not traced) to fly.’</p>

<p>“On hearing this my former companion, clenching
his hands and showing as intense a passion as
his dignity would allow—a magnificent figure in
those clothes of his (my clothes)—cried, ‘What?
Is it possible that one whom I have nourished,
tended and befriended should be guilty of so abominable
a crime? How wise we were to make the
regulation! How excellent and zealous are you in
your office thus to have found the first culprit who
attempted theft in this place! How admirable that
he should be brought to justice before he could
consummate his crime! How marked is the work
of Providence’—here he lifted his eyes to heaven—‘which
has given him up to us for an example!
Come, let us cut off his head with a blunt saw.’</p>

<p>“The officer who had thus traitorously caught
me bowed low and said, ‘Hearing and obedience!
But if my lord will take council I would speak.’</p>

<p>“‘What is it you would say?’ said my companion,
who resumed his seat but slowly and
seemed displeased at the interruption.</p>

<p>“‘My lord,’ said the official, ‘I suggest that if
you cut off his miserable head with a blunt saw,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
though doubtless it would have a good effect for
the moment and strike terror into the hearts of
those here who see it, so that never more shall
sheep be stolen from this market, nor ever more
shall we suffer as we have suffered in the past,
yet it would be of slighter effect than what I shall
propose. For to hear of a man’s execution is one
thing, but to hear his own relation of his sufferings
is another. I propose therefore that he shall
be beaten at great length but not to the point of
death; on the approaching of that consummation
let him be released to crawl away and tell his
story throughout our countries to whoever will
listen. Such an example would be of far more
service to the owners, my lord, than his death
would be, and I promise that he shall be beaten in
the most expert manner to the advantage of all
posterity.’</p>

<p>“Even as he advised so was it done. I was
given the bastinado without mercy until I thought
I should have expired, and then under every circumstance
of ignominy I was turned loose with a
week’s provision of coarse meal into that deserted
country, to spread terror among the servants of
the wealthy owners and by my example to deter
them from ever attempting to play tricks with
their masters’ goods.</p>

<p>“I, who from my youth have abhorred the ill
use of servants, I who had founded once so great
a fortune and proved so kind a master to hosts
of dependents, I in my ingenuousness and simple
heart could not have believed that such trickery
existed in the world! I had been wholly duped!</p>

<p>“As I limped from village to village, begging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
my bread, I heard the whole story and it exactly
confirmed the conclusion I had reached when I
first stood trembling before the Sheiks at the
Mosque.</p>

<p>“The shepherd in his poor clothes was the richest
sheep owner in the country. He and his fellow
lords had for some years past suffered from surreptitious
sales, they had appointed officers to
watch the markets and even so had not always
been able to recover the purchase money from
their agents. They had therefore—as I guessed—instituted
a system of Permits so that no man
could sell in the market without their signed
licences and so that each man so selling could be
detected as a thief by the officers of the markets.
But how should I, a poor stranger from over-sea,
know anything of this? The blackness of the
treason wounded me even more than the sufferings
of my bastinado. I almost lost my faith in man;
by the Everlasting Mercy I did not lose my faith
in Heaven!... Nothing, my boys,” said the old
man, his voice trembling, as he remembered this
terrible passage of the past, “nothing but Religion
supported me during the fearful days that
followed. I think I can say with humility that one
less founded in a firm reliance upon his Maker
would have grown embittered. I might have
turned into one of those useless people who, as
the result of misfortune, become railers, nourishing
a perpetual quarrel against mankind. But
our Holy Religion stood me in good stead, and as
my wounds healed and as my wanderings led me
further from the scene of my torture I recovered
so much of my spirits as once more to attempt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
what might have seemed impossible; I faced the
world again. It would seem that those for whom
Heaven has high designs, those for whom, like
myself, it intends the highest positions among
men, must in the divine scheme pass first through
the fire and the ordeal. Happy the men who
(like myself) profit by such visitations and retain
unclouded their childlike trust in God.”</p>

<p>“Amen,” murmured the eldest of the nephews.</p>

<p>“What was that you said?” cried Mahmoud
sharply?</p>

<p>“I said ‘Amen,’ Uncle,” answered the lad in
humble tones. His uncle scanned him narrowly.</p>

<p>“Well,” he muttered, “I suppose you are too
much of a fool to have meant it ill....”</p>

<p>At this the strident nasals of the Muezzin suddenly
shrieked from the neighbouring minaret
and the young lads with unaccustomed rapidity
vacated the great merchant’s apartment.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">When</span>
Mahmoud’s nephews reappeared before
him at the hour of public executions
it was in a certain weariness of spirit; for
though they knew that the fortunes of their uncle
must subsequently be recovered in the narrative
(since there he was before them, rolling, or, as the
phrase went in Bagdad, “dripping” with it) yet
the blows of fate had fallen upon him with such
violence in the recent tale that something of his
then despair had entered their own souls. They
sat down therefore with hanging heads to listen,
as they feared, to little better than the further
advance of intolerable things.</p>

<p>The old man began in a subdued voice of lamentable
recollection:</p>

<p>“I wandered on through the bare uplands, miserable,
weak, penniless and in rags. So far had my
soul fallen that on the seventh day I came near
to omitting my prayer at even ... but I thank
Heaven that this temptation was conquered! I
knelt down painfully upon the little carpet which
was my last possession and submitted myself to
the will of Allah.</p>

<p>“As though in answer to my prayer, and while
I still knelt there, I saw afar off the figure of one
who moved, as I could see from that distance,
with a carriage of leisure, and I hoped—I dared to
hope—that in answer to my prayer, I will not say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
a victim, but, at any rate, some provender was
to be afforded me.</p>

<p>“I hastened my steps to catch up the stranger,
and as I approached him remarked with pleasure
his fine clothes and stately manner. ‘I have here,’
said I to myself, ‘some Important Man, some one
doubtless unused to the base necessities of commerce;
simple, noble in mind, straightforward,
generous, amply provided: the very companion
whom I should desire.’ I turned over in my mind
(as I slackened my steps for a moment, so that
he should not yet observe my arrival) various
schemes whereby I might excuse my intrusion
upon his solitary walk. At last I hit on that
which seemed to me the most agreeable to his
supposed circumstances and to my appearance.
I strode up to him and bowing low asked him
whether his Greatness could direct a poor wretch
to a certain village the name of which I had heard
and which lay more or less in the direction I had
taken.</p>

<p>“The stranger turned to salute me and with
that I felt an added delight. For he was the very
thing I had prayed. Young, simple in manner,
courteous, probably, by his dress, independent and
wealthy; probably, as our language has it, ‘his
own father.’</p>

<p>“He wore rare ornaments; his cloak was of
the finest wool and the cord that bound his headdress
was interspersed with silver.</p>

<p>“By way of reply to my request, he told me
in a pleasant, deep voice, speaking after the
fashion of the rich, that he was himself strolling
towards it so far as his own house and farm, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
lay between, and that there he would put me upon
my way. I expressed my gratitude, and my fear
lest so bedraggled a companion might be distasteful
to him. He smiled and assured me that he
loved nothing better than converse. He had
visited a neighbour that morning to ask advice on
a certain set of pear trees of his which had not
been doing well. He had left his servant to follow
him with his mount, preferring this hour’s stroll
back homewards in the cool of the sunset hour
which had now descended.</p>

<p>“As we went we talked of many things and I
frankly told him the story of my life; for I have
discovered that nothing is more pleasing to men
of his station than the account of how another
has been reduced from wealth to poverty.</p>

<p>“‘I was not always,’ said I, as I strolled by his
side, ‘the deplorable figure you now see me. Indeed,
but a very few months ago I was the over-manager
of a great fruit plantation some hundred
miles to the north of this place. I had come with
good recommendations from my former employers,
planters of the Gulf. I had left these my
original masters with the best of characters and
the kindest of recommendations, and only because
the eldest son of one of the partners had to be
put into the business and there was no room for
both of us. I had accumulated in some years of
useful service a sufficient little capital which my
kind masters were so exceedingly generous as to
double, and I was able to put the total sum into
the new business to which I had been recommended.
For it is always better,’ I added, ‘to
have some stake in the firm.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘You are right,’ said my new friend in hearty
approval. ‘There is no greater error than to offer
a firm such intangible things as talent, honesty
and the rest. Valuable as they are, if they are
unaccompanied by metal they are without substance
and void.’</p>

<p>“With an expression of great humility I
applauded his reply and told him how flattered I
was to find that my judgment had jumped with
his. ‘But, alas, Sir!’ I continued deferentially,
‘There is no controlling the current of our destinies!
For there is One above——’</p>

<p>“‘I know, I know!’ agreed my companion hurriedly,
in the tones of one to whom the sentiment
was familiar and at the same time doubtful, and
I continued:</p>

<p>“‘By that Divine Will,’ I went on, ‘was I
visited. Heaven saw fit to try its servant. In the
course of my management I was sent to negotiate
the purchase of a cargo of lime-dressing at the
nearest port, for use upon the plantation. On my
way I had the misfortune to be robbed at an inn
of the pouch of gold that had been confided to me.
I ought, of course, to have returned at once and
told my partners and employers what had happened,
and to have offered, perhaps, to repair out
of my own property what might look like the result
of my own negligence; but I was afraid lest I
should not be believed, and again lest, if I were
believed, the loss should prejudice me in their
eyes as an incompetent. What I did was to go
forward to the port that very day, penniless, and
trust to the credit of my firm to complete the
transaction I had in hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘But once again I was unfortunate! I carried
through the negotiations with success and purchased
the cargo upon very reasonable terms. I
delayed to the last moment the payment of earnest
money and then, when delay would no longer
serve, I said carelessly, that full payment would
follow by messenger within two days. The merchant’s
face darkened. He told me that he had
been led on by false pretences, roughly bade me
begone and would hear no more of the transaction.
He refused to sign, and indeed left me abruptly,
saying that he was off to seek another purchaser
and telling me at the same time that he was
seriously considering whether or no to summon
me before the magistrate for having thus lost
him a whole day upon a false pretence.</p>

<p>“‘He was as good as his word, and I received
a summons from the magistrate that very evening
to attend his court the next day.</p>

<p>“‘It was unfortunate that during the night
another theft took place in the inn where I lay.
The bundles of those staying at the place were
searched. My own alone contained no valuables
of any kind. One would have thought that such a
circumstance would have spoken in my favour. It
was exactly the other way. It was argued that a
man who will stay in an inn without the means of
paying must be a thief of some sort and that since
the sum stolen was not to be found elsewhere
it was probably I, thus manifestly suspect of
trickery, who was the culprit. In my fright I
attempted to escape. I was caught and roughly
handled, with the final result that I appeared in
the magistrate’s court covered with blood, my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
garments torn and in such a posture subjected to a
double accusation upon the part of the innkeeper
and also upon the part of the foreign merchant
who appeared upon the original charge.</p>

<p>“‘In such distress I had no avenue of escape
save a reference to my honoured firm, the name
of which, though distant, was familiar to the
Court. The magistrate expressed his doubt that
I had any connection with such important people,
and asked me if I would risk the sending of a messenger
to my so-called partners. I said I would
do so gladly, but during the two days’ interval
of the messenger’s absence I was closely confined
in the public prison, where I regret to say the
foreign merchant had the heartlessness to come
and make faces at me through the bars, and where,
having no money to give my gaolers, I was treated
with the utmost harshness.</p>

<p>“‘My misfortunes were not at an end. As luck
would have it the firm to which I belonged and
of whose books I had the sole management, undertook
a surprise audit on the very day of my departure,
and discovered a most serious deficit in one
item which the partners, in their ignorance, could
not account for. Had I been present I could
easily have explained what had happened. It was
but an advance which I had made to a customer
whose transactions with us were of the highest
value. As much in my own interests as in those
of my partners I was well justified in risking the
money. I had acted foolishly perhaps in refusing
to take a receipt or to enter the matter in the
books, but the thing was only for a week and after
so many years of prosperity I could not dream of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
so small a thing turning out untowardly. However,
there it was. My partners hurriedly sent
after me and learned to their dismay that I had
left the first inn upon the road without payment,
and giving no account of my future movements.
They had sent a man post-haste on a swift horse.
He had covered the distance to the port in twelve
hours, but (as I was now in prison), could discover
nothing of me in the town nor find any
cargo I had bought or, indeed, any trace of me.
He returned to my partners, as they had instructed
him, upon another beast as swift (having
sold his spent mount) and it was just as they
received this grave news of my apparent absconding,
just while my partners grew more and more
convinced of my supposed guilt, that the messenger
from the magistrate arrived and
completed the accusation. They answered, not by
coming in person, but by sending a letter of the
most violent kind, calling me a notorious thief,
expressing their pleasure that I had been laid by
the heels and begging that, so far as they were
concerned, the magistrate would not spare me in
any punishment he might see fit to inflict
for my other escapades. Meanwhile (they
said) they would not trouble him to enter judgment
for the sum I had taken, since they had
replaced it out of my capital in the firm, which
nearly, or exactly, made good the deficit.</p>

<p>“‘You may imagine, my Lord, the result of
all this! The magistrate read the Court a sermon
on the justice of the law which spared no man for
his rank or commerce, and concluded, “You have
before you the sad spectacle of a man of substance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
fallen through temptation into poverty and disgrace.”
The foreign merchant contemptuously
waived his action, the innkeeper with equal contempt
expressed himself satisfied with the punishment
I had already undergone, claiming only my
clothes by way of payment, giving me these few
rags in exchange. With yet another admonition
the magistrate dismissed me. I went out from
the court a broken man, wandered aimlessly
southward, doing a little work here and there upon
the farms, and I am now seeking the next village
with the object of offering my services.</p>

<p>“‘Such, Sir,’ I concluded, ‘is my tale....
Here am I, with every commercial aptitude, and
full training in the various transactions of business
(but especially in the management of plantations)
for no fault of my own unable to exercise
these talents, rehabilitate my character, and
recover my position in society.’</p>

<p>“The rich young man was deeply touched by
my story, every word of which, I am glad to say,
he seemed to believe; for I was not deceived in
my reading of character and I had rightly
guessed that a man under thirty, honest-faced and
clearly enjoying leisure and wealth would be
singularly open to the reception of any romantic
tale that might be offered to him.</p>

<p>“‘It is indeed fortunate,’ he answered, ‘that
you understand plantations. It is a matter in
which I am for the moment interested. I have
an orchard which is not doing well.’ He had evidently
forgotten his first sentence on our meeting
which had given me my clue. But rich and generous
natures are like that in early youth: hence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
also, are they bad players in games of skill.</p>

<p>“‘Come with me,’ he continued, ‘and pass the
night in my house yonder’ (it already lay before
us in the hollow); ‘the conversation on your past
life, which is doubtless full of adventures, will
entertain me at my meal. To-morrow I will see
that you have occupation upon my farm, and after
a short experiment I think we shall get along very
well indeed together, particularly as I have recently
planted by way of experiment a number of
pear trees which—as I think I just told you—are
not doing well. I thought myself able from my
general knowledge to conduct this orchard, but I
regret to say that some of the trees have died, and
that the rest are in a poor way. I evidently lack
the special experience required. Since plantations
are your special line you may be of the
greatest service to me in this little matter.’</p>

<p>“Here, my dear nephews, I was in something
of a quandary. This, I am told, is a difficulty we
men of affairs come across often enough in the
conduct of our negotiations. It is our duty, as I
need hardly tell you, to add details of a corroborative
kind to the statements we have to make in
affairs. To omit any detail is to court suspicion.
On the other hand, one never knows where the
most necessary fictions may lead one. Here I was
confronted by the task of bringing to fruition an
orchard ... an orchard of pears ... and I
knew nothing whatever of orchards and of pears
far less.</p>

<p>“I replied, therefore, with the greatest enthusiasm
that the opportunity was exactly what I
should have desired. Orchards were the <i>one</i> kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of plantation I had most carefully studied, and of
all fruits <i>pears</i> were those upon which I had
specialised most. Once I had seen the kind of
tree my kind host had planted I should certainly
be able to tell him what was the matter.</p>

<p>“It was almost dark when we came to his
enclosure, but so eager was he on his new idea
that he led me at once to the back of the house
where the trees were planted. Very sickly indeed
did their gaunt twigs look in the gloaming. A
good third of them were shrivelled and dead, the
rest drooped in various degrees, one only gave a
promise of fruit out of some three hundred stems.
The rich man surveyed the ruin and gazed at me
anxiously while I held my chin in my hand as
though meditating upon the best course for him
to pursue, but in reality considering my own.</p>

<p>“Then it was, my dear infants, that I received
from on High one of those illuminations which
have always been, with me, the forerunners of
great things. I deliberately kept the rich young
man waiting for the space of a long prayer and
then said suddenly and with determination, ‘Scrap
the lot!... Excuse me,’ I added, ‘I have used a
phrase current in the barbaric cities of the north,
which is somewhat corrupt in speech. My intention
was to express to your Highness my conviction,
formed upon this rapid survey in gathering
darkness, that the orchard can no longer be saved,
for I am sure my judgment will be confirmed
when I make a more thorough examination to-morrow
morning in broad day. I see also, even
in this light, that the type of tree you have planted
is wholly unsuited to the climate. May I be so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
bold as to ask where you purchased the stock?’</p>

<p>“‘I was assured,’ answered my new friend a
little shamefacedly, ‘that it was stock grown
within this very region and peculiarly adapted
for our dry climate: for the drought of our position
which, as you know, stands too high for waterways.’</p>

<p>“I shook my head. ‘You were deceived,’ said
I. ‘Who sold you this unsuitable stock?’</p>

<p>“He told me that it was a sound friend of his
who had gone off for a while upon a journey, that
he was quite sure he had not intended to deceive.
‘Perhaps there was some error in the consignment
shipped to you,’ I answered cheerfully as we
turned towards the house. ‘This kind does admirably
in the River Lowlands, and I take it your
friend’s servants by some mistake sent your consignment
to some lowland client and <i>his</i> to <i>you</i>
in these uplands. Anyhow, the orchard is manifestly
doomed, as you can see, and for my part
I make no doubt that the trouble has come from
the use of a wrong species. Now what you want
here,’ I continued rapidly, turning over my
chances well in my mind, and plumping for technical
terms, ‘is a pear neither palinate nor
sublongate, nor, for that matter perforate, but
daxullic, or, as we sometimes call it in the trade
“retarded”—at any rate in the second and third
stirp.’</p>

<p>“‘I see; I understand; I apprehend,’ said the
rich young man. For thus, have I discovered, do
rich young men carry on a conversation which
leaves them entirely at sea.</p>

<p>“‘I do not,’ I hastened to add, ‘insist, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
course, upon the Persian stock, though that is the
best. It might be difficult to procure and it is
<i>very</i> expensive. What I mean is something of the
same family. I should advise, as a stock more
easily purchased in the local markets, the pear
called by the merchants “The Glory of Heaven.”</p>

<p>“‘It was introduced some few years ago by my
friend Nasredin and is now a favourite stock on
the Plateau of Reshed where the climate is very
similar to yours. It bears a large, luscious fruit,
highly marketable, and maturing early; and it can
be purchased at a moderate expense. I will, if you
like, go for you to the nearest provider of such
things and see what I can do.’</p>

<p>“My host thanked me profusely. He remarked
how small the world was and at the same time
how manifest were the workings of Providence.
He blessed the day when he had met me. For
though (he said), the matter of expense did not
weigh upon him, he had made a particular point
of success in the matter of pear trees, and but for
my advice he really did not know what he should
have done.</p>

<p>“He was so keen upon the affair that he pressed
me to start for the nearest nurseryman the very
next morning. There was an excellent nursery
plantation, he said, not more than half a day’s
ride away to the West. It stood, with the owner’s
house in the midst, just outside the gates of the
town to which he would direct me, either going
himself or sending his bailiff with me. He would
also send a wagon for the conveyance of the young
shoots. Indeed, as the meal progressed (for we
were now dining), he grew more and more enthusi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>astic
on the matter and could hardly bear the
delay of the night. I saw which way the land lay
and saw fit to increase his keenness. I therefore
told him it was quite impossible to act with such
speed. ‘The young shoots,’ said I, ‘must not be
left to lie untended and unplanted. We must first
of all prepare the ground. The old trees must be
dug up, the pits enlarged. It is the narrowness
of the earthing that has been half your trouble,
for the smaller root tendrils which we call “trips”
are easily estopped in hard groundings.’ ‘I see!’
said he, sapiently. ‘The ground must be well
soaked,’ I continued, ‘and manured with a full
dressing of lime, and only when all this has been
completed could I think of advising you to plant.’</p>

<p>“I paused to concoct something new, and the
amiable youth filled the gap for me by murmuring:
‘Precisely! Exactly! Now I understand.’</p>

<p>“I resumed: ‘Further we must underpin the
runners and work up the earth herring-wise.
And then there is the daubing.... It will be a
matter of full three days’ work. On the fourth
day I can set out before sunrise. You may take
it that I will be back by evening, and we will, if
you please, plant the very next morning—that is
on the fifth day—lest the stock should suffer; for
I have always found it,’ I added profoundly, ‘of
invariable service to plant immediately. I have
indeed lost in the past one or two most valuable
sets of trees—<i>pear</i> trees—by delaying at this season
of the year so much as twenty-four hours
before putting them in the ground.’</p>

<p>“As I thus spoke he nodded frequently, admiring
my talent and knowledge of these affairs, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
I took occasion, as evening wore on, to ground
him yet more deeply in this fascinating subject,
which I had already begun to feel was mine.</p>

<p>“The next day with the first of the light we
both of us set out to the orchard. He summoned
his workmen and our labours engrossed us for
many hours during which I fed his enthusiasm
with renewed tales of marvels in the way of fruit-growing—and
especially of pear trees. That particular
pear called ‘The Glory of Heaven’
increased wonderfully as I proceeded until at last
it had grown to such a size that each individual
fruit was as large as a child’s head, and half a
dozen of them would fetch a piece of gold ‘if’ (I
was careful to add) ‘if they are properly packed!
For I regret to say that, simple as the detail is,
the neglect of good packing has been the ruin of
most speculators in this line.’</p>

<p>“During the second day of our labours I dilated
upon other details of the trade which occurred to
me as I went along. I especially insisted upon
what I called the <i>maximum point</i>, and for this he
was all ears.</p>

<p>“‘There is a limit,’ I said, ‘to your plantation,
after which the expenses of management
begin to eat into the profits earned. A first small
speculation of 300 trees, such as you have here, is,
of course, a mere bagatelle. It would provide you
with amusement, but no appreciable income. The
most profitable size of orchard is far larger....
In such a situation as yours,’ said I, looking round
with an air of a connoisseur, ‘and with such soil
as this,’ and with that I took up a clod and carefully
crumbled it in my fingers, ‘possessing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
acidulated properties of this type, but corrected
by some slow exhaust of porphyritic matter, it
would need but a top dressing of bardulm and an
occasional picketing of charcoal to make some
3,000 trees produce a regular annual profit of not
less than 200 pieces of gold—and that upon an
original expenditure less than double the amount.
I would estimate your return with care and good
fortune at quite fifty per cent., but at any rate
you could calculate upon thirty per cent. But
<i>more</i> than 3,000 trees,’ said I, musing, ‘would, I
fear, be an error; the earnings after that get
eaten into by expenses.’</p>

<p>“He interrupted me with the eager words: ‘I
should be happy——’ I lifted my hand to check
him and said, ‘No! I assure you, that even such
a number as 3,500 would be just beyond the line,
and as you approach 5,000 you would find the
expense absorbing nearly all your profit. It is
as great an error to over-do these things as to
starve them. Let us fix the number at 3,000 and
the capital expenditure at
<span class="replace" id="tn_1" title="In the printed book: 4000">400</span> pieces of gold.
Then I think you will not be disappointed.’</p>

<p>“The third day I spent overlooking the levelling
of the ground and its last preparation, as also in
making mysterious marks with little pegs and jotting
down notes in a book: all of which excited
the owner to the last degree, and left him (as the
phrase goes) with his tongue hanging out for the
new trees.</p>

<p>“That evening my kind host after some little
embarrassment made me an offer. Would I, he
asked, share in the profits of the enterprise? I
at once refused. My decision surprised him: but,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
as he pressed the project upon me, I told him
that gratitude was only a part of my decision. I
owed him everything; he had found me—it
seemed a month ago indeed, though it was but
three days—in rags; he had clothed me, fed me
and, what was more, trusted me. His trust, I
assured him, would not be deceived. ‘I shall be
content,’ I concluded, ‘with the salary proper to
my position’ (he at once mentioned a sum, which
I halved), ‘but I will go so far as this; if, upon
the opening of the fourth year, your profits shall
be found to have <i>exceeded</i> what I have suggested,
if you make in the three years more than 600
pieces of gold, at 200 pieces a year, which I suggest
as the probable result, I will accept, though
reluctantly, one half of the excess. For I am
confident,’ and here I put an especially serious
tone into my voice, ‘that we shall do better than
I have said. I have ever held it my duty to give
a conservative estimate and to avoid the disappointment
of those who employ me. To this,
among other things, do I ascribe the great success
which attended me during my earlier years,
and which only failed me through the deplorable
accidents I related to you on our first meeting.’</p>

<p>“My host appeared a little confused at my
probity, or rather, at my scruples; but he told
me that he had always found such errors to be
upon the right side, and assured me that I should
not lose by the austerity of my temper. Nor did
I....</p>

<p>“We spent the rest of the evening looking at
the illuminations in his fine library. I expressed
myself enthralled by them all. I lingered with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
especial care over every representation of an
orchard in these pictures, and spoke in the most
learned manner of the various fruits therein displayed.
As luck would have it we came to one
particularly fine painting in which were delineated
the most enormous pears of a brilliant golden hue
interspersed with soft leaves. ‘This,’ I cried delightedly,
‘is the very fruit of which I have been
speaking! How interesting! How exciting!’</p>

<p>“‘Is that so?’ said my host, transported at the
coincidence, ‘Once more I must say it: how small
is the world!’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said I, ‘it is that pear “Glory of
Heaven,” of which I have been speaking and
which you may see, by comparison with the insects
here portrayed and of the trellis work, to be most
enormous fruit. Of its succulence I must leave
you to judge when you shall gather your first
harvest. Of its highly saleable quality in the
markets of the north you will, I trust, soon have
satisfactory experience.’</p>

<p>“‘I shall indeed!’ said my host, now quite
beside himself with the combined emotions of the
collector and the man of property. He blessed
again and again the day he had the good fortune
to meet such a man as myself. Summoning his
bailiff he gave orders for the wagon to be prepared
over night and the horses to be ready by
sunrise. ‘No, no,’ said I, ‘an hour before sunrise,
if you please! I am determined, at whatever
inconvenience to myself, to have the plants back
here, at your house, on the night of the same day.
I will risk no failure in this great affair!’ Again
he blessed and thanked me, and when his depen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>dents
were dismissed took me aside and prepared
to count out the money which would be required
for my expenditure.</p>

<p>“‘You said 400 pieces of gold,’ said he, as he
disposed the coins in little heaps of ten upon the
table. ‘You had better make it 500, for there
may have been fluctuations in the market since you
last purchased, and it is good that you should
have a margin.’</p>

<p>“I told him I thought the provision a wise one,
but that I would account for every penny when
he should next see me. And this, curiously
enough, was my true intention, though I could
not have given him any very exact date for our
next meeting. I wrote him out a formal receipt
in spite of his protests, remarking that business
was business; and so that every formality should
be accomplished I signed the document in the
name of an old friend of mine, one Daoud-ben-Yacoub.
I said I would further have affixed my
seal had I possessed one, but placed as I was,
no such instrument was available.</p>

<p>“‘The ball of your thumb will do,’ said the
young man carelessly. His words brought me up
rather sharp, and it was not without trepidation
that I acceded to this chance request. But once
more the inspiration of Heaven served me. I
dexterously substituted my middle finger for my
thumb as I pressed the wax thereunder. This
arrangement,” said the old merchant, as he
crossed the two fingers in the presence of his
nephews, by way of illustration, “I recommend
you upon every occasion of life. It is especially
useful in those tyrannical countries where the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
police take the thumb-marks of innocent wayfarers.
I have used it a dozen times.... But to
return to my tale.</p>

<p>“I pattered on to my kind host as I pressed my
finger down, and thus distracted his attention
from too close a watch on my hand. ‘This thumb
mark,’ said I, releasing my middle finger from the
wax, ‘this thumb mark is as good as any signature,
I think; for Allah has made it the sign
manual of all honest men; no two are alike. Remember,
pray,’ I added laughingly, ‘that it was
the thumb of my <i>right</i> hand.’</p>

<p>“‘I will,’ said he, laughing in turn. ‘As you
say, these are mere formalities. I do not think
the less of you for your insistence upon their
performance.’</p>

<p>“With these words we parted in the greatest
mutual satisfaction. He to dream of this fine new
plantation and his coming wealth, but I to pour
out my soul in prayer to my Maker and humbly
to ask for further guidance.</p>

<p>“Next morning while it was yet dark I rose
and mounted, the bailiff at my side, and the slaves
taking the wagons behind. Early as was the hour
my kind host was astir; he gave me his blessing
for the tenth time on my departure and poured
out petitions for my safe return. I hung the
pouch of gold to my saddle bow, where I securely
fastened it; I took the weapon with which he
had kindly provided me in case of any misadventure
by the road, and left him under the benediction
of God. I thought a little sadly, as we rode
out in silence through the gate and out on to the
bare uplands again, how transitory were all human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
affections. How short had been this episode of
friendship and hospitality! How brief even in
the short course of one human life are these passages
of complete confidence and brotherly kindness!
When should we meet again?</p>

<p>“Of my journey there is little to be related.
We plodded on, our pace necessarily determined
by that of the slow wagon following us and my
mind still turned upon what my future action
should be; for, to tell you the truth, my dear
nephews, Allah had vouchsafed me no revelation,
in spite of my earnest prayers during the night,
and I was still considering what turn I should
give to the affair when once more that Infinite
Mercy which has never failed me (or, at any rate,
only for some short few days and even so but to
chastise my pride) came to my rescue.</p>

<p>“There are, in this country, deep gullies called
<i>nullahs</i>, the course of streams which run but
rarely on these heights, but which, when they run,
dig their channels deeply into the friable soil.
The crossing of these gullies by any rolling vehicle
is something of a business. As we reached one,
therefore (they came at intervals of two or three
miles) the bailiff and I were careful to dismount
and help the slaves with the wheels.</p>

<p>“It was while thus engaged during our careful
drop into the second <i>nullah</i> that the inspiration
from on high flashed into my brain. I perceived
that the wheels of the wagon were fastened to the
hub with wooden pins, one of which, at the off-hind
wheel which I was holding back, looked a little
loose. The slaves had their backs turned to me,
holding back the front wheels, and checking the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
horses; at the other hind wheel, with the body of
the front wagon between us and concealing his
view from mine, strained and heaved the bailiff,
a fat, elderly rogue, unaccustomed to such work.
I pulled out the pin, threw it into the depths
of the neighbouring scrub, and as I did so
continued to cry, ‘Steady there! Steady! So!
Hold hard! That’s better! Woa-oh! Stand by!’
and other words of the sort, which showed my
interest in the operation. I could see the wheel
wobbling as we crossed the flat bed of the <i>nullah</i>.
At the foot of the far rise it was nearly off. The
time had come. ‘Now!’ I cried suddenly, ‘<i>All
together</i>! Whip up the horses and shove!’ The
whips cracked, the slaves hauled at the traces, the
horses strained, up went the wagon, off came the
wheel and the whole collapsed upon one side with
a great din and with a sharp cracking, as though
something had given way.</p>

<p>“And so it proved to be; for the main axle,
though not snapped, had split; so there we were
with the wagon out of service for the moment, the
axle unsure, a hind wheel off, and the whole contraption
on its side.</p>

<p>“The bailiff was seriously disturbed. It seemed
that my kind host was a firm master, that he had
his moments of sharp temper; and the bailiff
bewailed his fate and considered what awaited
him on his return. I laughed good-naturedly and
reassured him.</p>

<p>“‘Come, come,’ said I, ‘it is no great matter!
I understand these things. Do you ride on towards
the town. I will help the slaves put back the
wheel. We will make some sort of jury pin to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
put into the hub, we will tie a rope round the
cracked axle, and all will be well. We are men
enough between us to repair the wagon, but you,
as I say, ride forward. I shall soon catch you up.’</p>

<p>“The bailiff was relieved at this proof of my
efficiency and good will, and delighted to be
released from the work to which he was quite
unused. He rode on at a moderate pace while the
slaves and I heaved the wagon back upright. I
fashioned a jury pin out of a piece of the scrub
and I was careful to make it too weak for its work.
We bound a piece of rope round the axle and when
all this was done I bade them go forward carefully
lest a further accident should befall. I then rode
on smartly to catch up the bailiff, who had by this
time got about a mile ahead. As I neared him I
looked back from an intervening rise of land. It
was as I had anticipated. The jury pin had given
way, and the wagon was on its side again: but the
lift of land soon hid it from me and down on the
further slope I caught up the bailiff, ambling
along. ‘The wagon is all right,’ said I, ‘but it will
have to go rather slow.’ He gave a great sigh of
content. ‘Thanks be!’ said he. ‘Truly you are a
genius!’</p>

<p>“‘Not at all!’ said I modestly. ‘It is quite a
small accident and of a sort to which I am accustomed;
but do you ride back now that everything
is well, for the slaves are uneducated men’ (this
sort of flattery is honey to bailiffs), ‘and will need
some one of your standing to moderate their pace
and to check their horses and to see that the
wagon comes on in good condition. Go very carefully,
for the axle is weak. When you shall reach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
the town we will get a proper pin and have everything
put right in an hour or two, meanwhile I will
go forward and we will make an appointment at
the market gardener’s, which you will reach, I
think, some three-quarters of an hour after myself.
For we are now, I take it, some couple of hours
from the town.’</p>

<p>“‘You are right,’ said the bailiff, ‘you have but
to follow the track and we will come after you.’
With that he turned back. Once I had seen him
disappear behind the rise of the hill I dug my
spurs sharply into my poor horse and went at top
speed across the <i>bled</i>.</p>

<p>“I am a poor rider and had not my saddle been
ample and my stirrups weighty I should have
fallen. But Providence was with me once again.
I came through a gap of rocks and saw, immediately
before and below me, the white domes
and flat roofs of a large city, and just outside the
gate a fine plantation of young fruit trees, which
I recognized as the nursery gardener’s.</p>

<p>“I had ridden past his house and grounds, and
admired the young pear trees especially (a fine
collection) when a useful thought occurred to me,
and I acted on it at once, eager though I was to
save time. I turned back and said to the slave at
the gate of the plantation, ‘I have a message for
your master. Tell him that if any one asks for
Daoud-ben-Yacoub, he has bidden me say that he
went back by a short cut to help his companions
with a broken wagon.’ I then turned again and
rode off towards the city walls.</p>

<p>“I approached the town and rode through the
gate with dignity in the new fine clothes the young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
lord had given me. I nodded in a superior manner
to the guard and made straight for the opposite
entrance to the city. A horse fair was proceeding.
I put up mine at an inn, took off the bag of
gold (which was heavy, but not too heavy to be
carried) walked towards the market and asked
where I could best purchase a horse. The name
of a horse-seller was given me. I approached
him, failed to believe all that he told me with
regard to the beast he offered, but said it would
be enough for my purpose. I had not an idea
whither to fly, yet fly I must, for sooner or later
the bailiff or my late master himself must follow.
I knew nothing of the country nor the names of its
towns nor of the roads. I took refuge in a piece
of diplomacy. As I paid for the horse, I said to
the seller, that I had to reach my mother’s house
in the next city before sundown, and that I hoped
my purchase was able to carry me that far in the
remaining half-day.</p>

<p>“‘Half a day’s riding?’ answered the merchant
in astonishment. ‘I know not how you ride! If
you mean the town of Taftah it is not more than
three hours’ going for any reasonable mount.’</p>

<p>“‘Is that so?’ said I in surprise. ‘I am a
stranger and I can only believe what I was told.
But you know how vague these country people
are. I was assured that this was the road to
Taftah,’ and here I pointed through the eastern
gate.</p>

<p>“‘Yes! That is the road,’ he said. ‘You can
easily reach your mother’s house before evening
upon this beast,’ he said, clapping its crupper.
‘Without doubt you will be there long before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
prayer: and God be with you, Hassan!’ For,
incidentally, it was as Hassan that I had done
business with him.</p>

<p>“I paid him ten pieces of gold for the beast.
(It was more than it was worth). I humbly
repeated his prayer which I felt did apply with
peculiar force to me now, for I was conscious that
I was once more under the beneficent guidance of
Heaven—who could not be with that heavy pouch
now hanging again on his saddle? I rode out
therefore confidently, quite careless whether I
killed the beast or no in my rapid progress and
brought it into Taftah well within three hours in
such a state that I was delighted to find a purchaser
(to whom I gave my name as Abdurram,
and my profession as that of a leather dresser),
who offered but five pieces of gold: I was glad to
be rid of the horse and him at that.</p>

<p>“Time still pressed. I might be traced. I knew
not what accidents had occurred upon the road
behind me, whether indeed those poor fools had
managed to mend the wagon again, if not, whether
the bailiff would have the courage to tell his
master or ride on to find me in the first town. If
he had so ridden on he might find evidences of my
departure, and even (more doubtfully) of my
second horse and its purchase.</p>

<p>“But though time pressed it would have been
fatal to show any too great speed. I therefore
sauntered very gradually in my fine clothes, afoot,
bearing my pouch in my hand concealed under
the fold of my garment, until I reached a gathering
of merchants outside a sort of Exchange
which this town of Taftah boasted, like others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of the neighbourhood, in the vicinity of the
governor’s palace.</p>

<p>“It was there that, during a conversation which,
for all my anxiety, I took care to make slow and
dignified, I learned how <i>dates</i> were in great
demand in a large city called Laknes, about two
weeks’ journey beyond the hills. It was, to a
business man like myself, a most fascinating story
that I heard! The people of that far country
were passionately fond of dates and gave that
fruit the briskest market imaginable. Their
appetite had grown all the more formidable since
the next people immediately beyond them had
passed a law prohibiting the culture and sale of
all dates on account of the toothache sometimes
arising from that fruit. With this reduction of
supply Laknes became more of a bidder for dates
than ever. Great rewards were offered to any
taking the fruit to such a market. The last
advices, not a month old, quoted thirty dinars the
kantar and were rising. The merchants designed
to despatch a caravan the day after the morrow.</p>

<p>“With equal leisure and dignity I left them
after this little talk and made it my immediate
business in the next half-hour to procure with
the capital at my disposal a number of camels
and a couple of bales of dates for each, together
with a few slaves that should conduct the caravan
to its destination; I also hired a free man for a
leader, as he was acquainted with the road.</p>

<p>“By this time it was nearly dark. I had given
orders (in order to conceal my movements) that
I should not start till late in the week, but I had
also given a child a small coin to come up to me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
upon a signal, with a piece of paper folded, upon
which indeed nothing was written. Just as the
camels were being driven off to their litter, I
signalled to the child, who ran up and gave me the
note. I opened it before the head man, put on an
air of great perturbation, and said, ‘This message
changes all my plans! I fear I disturb you, but
will you start out to-night?’</p>

<p>“‘Willingly,’ said he. ‘We have provisions,
and I know a good place on the road where we
can purchase more to-morrow. The weather is
warm and if your business demands haste, it may
be better to march during the cool.’ The slaves
(who were not consulted) were no doubt agreeable
enough. We set out and all that night went our
way.</p>

<p>“It was a monotonous journey through an arid
land, with few towns or villages, sufficient watering,
but no more. Though I pressed the pace we
lost no beasts, and on the twelfth day, with the
cool of the evening, we reached Laknes.</p>

<p>“My camels were parked, I took my place in the
chief inn of the city (under the name of Ishmaïl-of-Taftah,
merchant), and my first act before
ordering a meal was, again, from the very bottom
of my heart, to thank Allah for the return of
his mercies. My capital was, indeed, nearly
exhausted. I had but a few pieces of gold left in
my garment, and the pouch was empty; but there
was my solid row of camels and my fine cargo of
dates. I made no doubt I should sell at a good
profit next day and that my career was once more
launched. I took care to speak to all openly of
my arrival, to hint at my wealth, to make all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
familiar with the name of Ishmaïl-of-Taftah, a
merchant in dates which it was proposed to offer
next day in the market. For there are occasions,
my dear nephews, in commerce when it is perfectly
advisable to tell the truth and even to
spread it abroad.”</p>

<p>With these unexpected words the merchant
Mahmoud suddenly ceased his tale, for the shriek
of the Muezzin was heard rending the air. The
nephews rose and bowed. “We trust,” said the
eldest, “that when we next appear we shall find
you, my dear uncle, climbing from greatness to
greatness in the story you still have to unfold.”</p>

<p>“Alas, my children,” answered the venerable
sage, “I fear you must hear of other disappointments
before the goal is reached!”</p>

<p>At this the youngest boy put forth his lower
lip, which trembled, and began screwing up his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Stop!” said the merchant testily. “Stop! My
little fellow! I have had enough of this!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle,” sobbed the boy, “I cannot bear to
think that perhaps all that new wealth will be
stolen from you.”</p>

<p>“Stop, I say!” shouted Mahmoud angrily, and
half-rising, “I tell you I have had enough of it!
I appreciate your motive. I admire your judgment.
It is marvellous in so young a child. But
I cannot be disturbed with useless tears at things
so long past. You show too great a sympathy.
You are too sensitive my dear.”</p>

<p>The child saluted, assumed a more equable
appearance, and followed his brothers out of the
room, while Mahmoud, his equipoise a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
disturbed by the incident, set himself right by the
simple process of drawing from one sleeve a
handful of coins and counting them out slowly
into the other: a pastime which never failed to
restore him to the best of tempers.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
  <small>ENTITLED <i>AL-JAMAL WA’L-NAKHL</i>, <br />OR CAMELS AND DATES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">When</span>
the hour of public execution had
arrived the boys came timorously into their
rich uncle’s presence, and seating themselves
upon the expensive carpet at the feet of his
divan, prepared to hear the continuation of his
adventures.</p>

<p>That excellent old man began as follows:</p>

<p>“I warn you, my children, that the path to
wealth, which (by the Mercy of Allah) I have been
allowed to tread, is varied and difficult. Profit by
my misadventures! Remain determined to enrich
yourselves, even after the worst mishaps! Yea!
After wealth and poverty (like mine) renewed
wealth and (alas!) renewed poverty never
despair. Still hold to gold and still determine
your fate. Still thirst for money. But all the
while most reverently worship Him the Supreme,
the All-compelling, the Giver of Great bags of
coin. No talent in the deception of individuals
or the gulling of the crowd can of itself bring
the great reward. The acquirement of those
immense sums which are the chief glory of man,
is, like all else, in the Hand of God.</p>

<p>“My brother, your worthy though impecunious
father, has sufficiently grounded you in the essentials
of our holy religion. You will not repine if
you turn out to be one of the ninety-nine who end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
their lives in the gutter, rather than the blessed
hundredth who attains, as I have attained, to
the possession of a palace and of innumerable
slaves....”</p>

<p>Having so spoken the aged merchant bent for a
moment in silent prayer and then proceeded:</p>

<p>“You will remember that at the conclusion of
my last adventure I had reached a position, not of
affluence, but at least of tolerable fortune. I was
possessed of a train of camels, each heavily laden
with two large panniers of dates, and drivers to
conduct the whole.</p>

<p>“You will further remember how, on my arrival
in
<span class="replace" id="tn_2" title="In the printed book: Lanknes">Laknes</span>,
as I was anxious to make the best of
my time I spoke freely to all of my merchandise,
extolled its character, described how I intended
to put it up for sale next day in the public markets,
and spread abroad the name of Ishmaïl-of-Taftah
which happened for the moment to be mine.</p>

<p>“The rumour spread (as I had intended it
should). I strolled through the narrow streets
of the town after sunset, and was glad to hear my
arrival discussed, and my wares. I had promise
for the morrow. I returned to my men.</p>

<p>“I had already spread out my bed upon the
corner of the yard, when there came up a slave
magnificently dressed, who bowed to the ground,
and approaching my presence asked whether he
had the honour and felicity to address the
renowned merchant
<span class="replace" id="tn_3" title="In the printed book: Ismaïl">Ishmaïl</span>.
He bore an invitation
from the greatest merchant in the city, whose
name I had already heard half a dozen times in
Taftah, and whom all the merchants there revered
from afar for his enormous riches: a certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Yusouff ben Ahmed, also called ‘El-Zafari,’ or
the Triumphant.</p>

<p>“Late as was the hour I purchased finery; with
my last gold I hired a donkey of strange magnificence,
and arrived at the palace of Yusouff,
dressed in a fashion which I could ill afford, but
which I regarded as an investment.</p>

<p>“I had expected to find within this palace that
admirable simplicity of manner which is inseparable
from really great wealth: Nor was I
disappointed. The inner room to which I was led,
encrusted everywhere with black marble, boasted
no ornament save three white alabaster jars as
tall as a man and of immense antiquity. They
had formerly been the property of a young noble
whom Yusouff had ruined, and <i>he</i> had them of
the Sultan. In the midst shone the single pure
flame of a massive silver lamp, rifled from the
tomb of a saint. It now hung dependent from a
chain of the same metal, the height of which was
lost in the gloom of the lofty cupola.</p>

<p>“A fountain of scented water—I could not name
its odour precisely, but I guessed it to be Fior
de Goyim—plashed gently into a basin of porphyry
at the end of the apartment.</p>

<p>“Yusouff and two other guests (who alone had
been asked to meet me), rose from the exceedingly
costly rugs of Persia whereon they had reclined,
and gravely saluted me. The master of the house,
after the first salutations and an invocation upon
my head of the Mercy of Allah, told me that the
feast was ready prepared, but that before summoning
it he would ask me to honour the house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and survey what poor ornaments he might be
able to show me.</p>

<p>“I was expressly delighted at his tone. It was
that which I had already heard to be native to
princes of commerce. He had already acquired,
in the few years that had elapsed since he had
cleaned the streets for a living, a well-bred
restraint of gesture, and when he spoke it was in
the tone of one who thought negligible the whole
world, including his guest. I prayed fervently,
as I accompanied the leisurely steps of my great
entertainer, that when I should have achieved a
similar fortune I should myself as quickly acquire
this distinctive manner of the great. I watched
him narrowly in order to imitate (when I should
have left his presence) those peculiar little details
which mark affluence and are of such service in
negotiation. He would often interpose words of
his own into the midst of another’s sentence. It
pleased him not to answer some repeated question.
He would change the conversation at his pleasure
without too much regard for what I might have
been saying immediately before. He also turned
to another guest, while I was addressing him and
in every way showed his superiority.</p>

<p>“When we had sat down to meat I was further
edified by the varied information, the extensive
culture of my host. He would lead the talk on to
some subject which he had recently acquired from
his numerous secretaries, and dally upon it at a
length which would have been tedious in one of
lesser station. But all this was done with such
an air of <i>money</i> that it was impossible to feel the
slightest tedium, though his minute description of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
things which we all knew by heart extended more
than once to a full quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>“During the progress of this divine repast I
noted with pleasure that the distinguished master
of the house never once introduced the subject of
my affairs.</p>

<p>“I would have you remember, my dear
nephews,” said Mahmoud at this point, “that
nothing is less pleasing in a merchant, especially
in one of approved success, than the introduction
of profit and loss at a meal; for profit and loss
are of such profound importance that their mere
mention must distract from the legitimate pleasures
of the table.</p>

<p>“It was not until a late hour, when the two other
guests (whose insignificant names I have not
attempted to retain) had arisen to depart, that
affairs began.</p>

<p>“With the subtle tact of commercial genius my
host retained me, gripping my arm. I ventured in
the absence of any witness to say a few words
upon what was nearest my heart: I asked him
‘<i>How were dates?</i>’</p>

<p>“To my delight he proved affable. He unbent
in a degree unworthy of so small an occasion and
listened with the greatest attention to my simple
tale. I told him frankly that I had with me at
the moment but few camels (I was under no necessity
to confess that I had not another asset in
the world). I suggested by my negligent tone
that such a number could hardly be called a
caravan and was little more than a distraction
with which I amused myself on my travels. I
then dropped the fact that I had loaded them—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>more
as a pastime than anything else—with a few
<i>dates</i>.</p>

<p>“At this second mention of the word ‘<i>dates</i>’
the face of Yusouff-the-Blessed suddenly changed.
He at first cast his eyes down in an expression of
real concern. Then, looking up at me anxiously
and steadily, he said:</p>

<p>“‘This is no affair of mine.... You may
resent my interference.’</p>

<p>“I assured him that I desired nothing more
than a hint from one so favoured of Heaven.
How I had better dispose of my trifling merchandise?
I was more anxious to hear his reply than
it is possible to say!</p>

<p>“He sighed heavily, shook his head, and
answered with a certain familiarity that I could
not resent:</p>

<p>“‘My poor friend...!’</p>

<p>“He then sighed again and added:</p>

<p>“‘I really do not see how I can advise you....
The truth is that dates will from henceforth be
almost unsaleable here. There has lately taken
place—indeed it was but last week—an extraordinary
thing. The mother of our Emir—the
dowager—has left by will the whole of her
immense date groves in trust to the nation with
orders that regular weekly distribution shall be
made <i>free</i> to all the citizens. We are bidden
praise her generosity and the masses are of course
delighted. But it is ruin for the poor merchants
whose stock of dates are now so much dross.
They cannot sell to our neighbours in the country
over the border, for these hold dates to be evil
from their effect in giving the toothache. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
new law, called the Date Prohibition Act, is of the
most rigorous kind. I have myself (from a sense
of public duty) bought up the greater portion at
a ruinous loss to prevent the failure of smaller
men and to avoid a panic. I have sacrificed myself
to the public good.’ He sighed heavily once more
and was silent.</p>

<p>“You may imagine, my dear nephews, the effect
of this news upon your unfortunate uncle! The
panniers of dates (two for each camel) were,
save the animals themselves, all that I had in the
world. I had traversed the waste at the cost of
much labour, infinite privation, and mortal perils,
precisely because this district had the reputation
of being by far the best market for dates, and
here was I, with an enemy left behind me, alone
in the world, and my sole venture ruined.... I
remembered my dreadful poverty, only so recently
past, and I shuddered as I considered those unsaleable
dates and my black future! Before me was a
country where dates were rigorously forbidden
by law; behind me a hue and cry. Despair was in
my heart!</p>

<p>“Though I trust I have a sufficient degree of the
arts essential to our profession, Yusouff must
have guessed my thoughts. Ignoring my former
statement that the goods I had with me were but
a toy, and that I was indifferent to their fate, he
expressed the deepest sympathy with my plight
and begged me to bear with him while he reflected
within himself how he might be of service.</p>

<p>“Having said this he covered his face with his
right hand, bowed his head, leant his elbow upon
his knee, and for some moments was plunged in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
what merchants use as thought. When he raised
his face I was shocked to see how haggard it had
become, and I marvelled that one so circumstanced
should care so much for the chance misfortunes
of a stranger. But I had read that these Princes
of Commerce were often of tenderest heart and
that one should never be surprised at any freak
of generosity on their part.</p>

<p>“Judge therefore of my delight on hearing
Yusouff say in a determined voice that he had
concluded upon the only issue and that he would
purchase my dates himself!</p>

<p>“‘I cannot’ (he frankly added) ‘give you as
good a price even as I could have given a day or
two ago; the old Queen’s idea of free dates has
swamped everything. But I will pay a good
quarter of the customary price—which is far more
than you now could obtain elsewhere. I am very
wealthy. You are a stranger and, as it were, our
guest in this town. A good deed is never thrown
away. Perhaps some day I shall be glad of your
aid also. I have seen you a few hours only, but
I think we know each other’s hearts already.
Moreover, I do not conceal it from you, I <i>may</i>
save much of the loss. I have special correspondents
in distant towns, and opportunities of sale
which others do not possess.... Come! I’ll do
it! I will offer you this price of one-third. It is
but a poor price,’ said he, sighing yet again most
heavily, ‘but it is far, far better than no price at
all.’</p>

<p>“My relief was beyond words. I had seen
myself leaving my merchandise unsold or sacrificing
it at a ruinous nothing. That which Yusouff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
offered me was the difference between despair and
a shred of hope, and though the loss was severe it
left me at least with some capital for a further
venture.</p>

<p>“Great men have a sort of simplicity in their
dealings. Hardly had Yusouff discovered my
gratitude and my immediate acceptance of his
gift (for I could call it by no other name), than
the princely fellow clapped his hands, sent for
his treasurer, and had counted to me upon the
spot a hundred pieces of gold. I gave him my
writing of delivery, which he handed to another
slave with a few words in a low voice. Then he
continued to talk to me, for he was determined
to detain me far into the night. Indeed it was
near dawn before he whom I will now call my
friend, and to whom I felt bound for life by the
greatest ties of grateful affection, allowed me to
pass his gates and to return to my hostelry.</p>

<p>“There I found that my panniers had already
been removed and their contents conveyed to the
purchaser’s warehouse. I admired the promptitude
in business which so often accompanies a
generous heart.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“With the early hours of the next day, before
the sun had yet acquired too great power, I
strolled through the bazaar, not so much cast
down at the thought of my loss as cheered by the
recollection that I possessed, after all, one hundred
good pieces of solid gold.</p>

<p>“With a malicious pleasure I approached the
stall of a fruit-seller. Putting down a small
copper coin I begged him for a handful of dates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘I need not full measure,’ said I, ‘only a
handful to munch as I go along.’ For I knew that
in the state of the market my penny might have
purchased a gallon. I desired to show a neglect
for small sums.</p>

<p>To my surprise the fruit-seller stared at me and
said:</p>

<p>“‘Dates? From what country do you come
that you ask for <i>dates</i> in our town?’</p>

<p>“‘Why!’ said I, ‘is there not a glut of these? I
am told the place is overflowing with them.’</p>

<p>“‘There is One-who-judges,’ said the fruit-seller
resignedly. ‘But as for dates—you will not
find one in the whole town; our last month’s
arrival was pillaged by robbers in the hills. If
you will but procure me a single gallon I will
readily give in return two pieces of gold, so great
is the demand. Of supply there is none whatever,
nor, alas! any prospect of such.’</p>

<p>“I was so bewildered that I hardly know what
next I said, but at any rate, in reply to it, my new
acquaintance told me that there were, indeed,
<i>suspected</i> to be certain dates in the possession
of Yusouff-the-Triumphant, ‘who’ (he remarked
aside) ‘has all the luck.’ He next said it was also
rumoured that Yusouff’s slaves had been seen in
the last hours of the night going in procession
with a great number of panniers laden on mules
towards Yusouff’s warehouse, and those who
brought the news swore that they could smell the
smell of dates.</p>

<p>“‘But beyond that smell,’ he ended, ‘we have
had nothing of dates in the place for three weeks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
And if you understood our habit in the matter of
food you would feel for us!’</p>

<p>“I have already described to you, my dear
nephews, my admiration for Yusouff-the-Triumphant.
Long before I had seen him his distant
reputation had inflamed me. My brief acquaintance
with him had exalted that feeling to what I
had thought the highest pitch. But now it passed
all bounds. A man so subtle in negotiations! So
ready in affairs! So rapid and conclusive in a
bargain! With so marvellous a command of
feature and of tone! A man (in a word) so
infinitely my superior in that profession of
commerce to which Allah calls all great souls and
in which I also was engaged! Such a man I had
never thought to meet! Nay—I had never thought
such a one to exist upon this poor earth. I could
have kissed the ground upon which he walked or
have borne upon me for ever, as a relic, some
thread of his purse.</p>

<p>“‘Here,’ I exclaimed, ‘is the true merchant!
Here is the model of all that a man of affairs
should be! Oh! Mahmoud, you thought yourself
something in your trade, but you have met your
master, and more than your master! You have
met one who is to you as the most holy of saintly
men is to the basest of the Kafir. There is <i>none</i>
on earth like him. Allah has raised him beyond
all others.</p>

<p>“But it is not enough, my dear nephews,”
continued the old man, whose eyes were now filled
with a sort of sacred light, “it is not enough to
admire those who set us great examples. We
should also imitate them. I determined after so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
rare an experience to follow as best I might in
the footsteps of one who had shown himself raised
high above the level of mortality.</p>

<p>“‘Him,’ said I to myself, ‘him will I copy! <i>He</i>
shall be my guide! <i>His</i> manner and his tone, on
that unforgettable evening, shall be my exact
model! Then perhaps in time I shall do as he has
done and accumulate so great a store of money as
shall put me among the greatest of mankind.’</p>

<p>“I hastened to summon my slaves. I paid my
score for the stabling, and as I looked at my small
capital and surveyed my beasts I hesitated what
I should do. Yusouff-the-Triumphant had, by
God’s special grace overshadowing him, got hold
of my substance. Nothing was left me but the
camels. In such a strait I abandoned the thought
of men and turned at once to heaven. I lifted up
my heart to my Maker and prayed for guidance.
He that has never for very long abandoned His
servant answered my prayer with singular alacrity,
for even as I prayed I heard two men who
passed me muttering one to the other.</p>

<p>“The first, as they hurried along, was saying in
fearful undertones:</p>

<p>“‘They have not yet a camel among them! Yet
camels they must have or the terrible sentence
will be pronounced!’</p>

<p>“‘Yes!’ returned his companion in a horrified
whisper, ‘I fear greatly for my relatives in that
town, and I am proceeding there to make certain
that they shall have at least <i>one</i> camel in so
terrible a time! For if a sufficiency of camels is
not there by to-morrow noon I hear they are all
to be impaled!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>“So speaking in subdued accents of terror, little
knowing they were overheard, they walked on
while I followed and noted every word.</p>

<p>“My mind was immediately made up. I continued,
with stealthy feet, to follow these two
anxious beings who were so engrossed in the
coming misfortunes of their native place. At last,
when we had come to an empty space where three
streets met, I caught them up and faced them.
Accosting them I said:</p>

<p>“‘Sirs, are you bound for such and such a
place?’ (naming a town of which they could never
have heard—for indeed it did not exist).</p>

<p>“They stopped and looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>“‘No, sir,’ they answered me together, ‘we are
bound in all haste for our native place which is
threatened with a great calamity. Its name is
Mawur, but, alas, it is far distant from us—a
matter of some twenty leagues—the desert lies
between, and we shall hardly reach it within the
day that remains. For we are poor men, and only
with fast <i>camels</i>’ (at this word they glanced at
each other and shuddered) ‘could the journey be
accomplished in the time.’</p>

<p>‘I thanked them politely, regretted that I had
disturbed them for so little, proceeded with the
utmost haste to my caravan, inquired the road for
Mawur (the track for which lay plain through
the scrub and across the sand), and hastened
with the utmost dispatch all that burning day and
all the succeeding night without repose, until at
dawn I passed with my exhausted train through
the gates of the city. I had covered in twenty
hours twice as many leagues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Five of my beasts I left upon the road; and
some few of my slaves—how many I had not yet
counted—had fallen out and would presumably
die in the desert. But there was a good remainder.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately I was not alone in my venture,
for I discovered that early as was the hour
another man had arrived already with two camels
and was standing with them under the dawn in
the market-place. Poor beasts they were, and
bearing every mark of fatigue. But I was determined
upon a monopoly. I had hoped from the
conversation I had overheard that not a single
camel would be present in the place. I would
secure myself against even the slightest competition.
I approached the leader of the two sorry
camels and asked him there and then what he
would take for his cattle. He stared at me for a
moment, but to my astonishment when I offered
him for a beginning the derisory price of ten
pieces of gold, he accepted at once, put the coins
into his pouch, smiled evilly, and moved off at a
great pace.</p>

<p>“To my chagrin there approached within a very
few moments yet another peasant, leading this
time but one camel, a rather finer beast than the
others. I hoped, I believed, he would be the last.
I made haste to follow the same tactics with him
as with the first. Like the first he took the five
gold pieces without so much as bargaining, but
he looked me up and down strangely before shrugging
his shoulders and taking himself off hastily
down a side lane.</p>

<p>“And then (the people beginning to drift into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the street as the day rose) appeared a man leading
not less than ten camels in a file. I was
seriously alarmed, but I bethought me of my
reading: how all great fortunes had been
acquired by speculation, how caution and other
petty virtues were the bane of true trade. I
boldly approached him and offered him my remaining
gold for the whole bunch. Instead of
meeting my offer with a higher claim, he asked
to look narrowly at the pieces, and then looked
as narrowly into my face. He took one of the
gold pieces and bit it. He stooped and rang it
upon the cobble-stones. He determined apparently
that it was good, and without another word
took my gold, appealed to those around us as
witnesses to the transaction, handed me the leading
cord, and with a burst of laughter ran off at
top speed.</p>

<p>“Here, then, was I with my thirteen new camels
and what was left of my original caravan. I will
not deny that I was somewhat disturbed in mind;
but I could only trust in Allah. I did so with
the utmost fervour, and implored Him to consider
His servant, and to see to it that not another
camel should reach the town before I began to
sell.</p>

<p>“But what is man? What is he that he should
order the movements of the Most High?</p>

<p>“I lifted up my eyes and saw approaching
down the narrowness of the street a file of certainly
not less than one hundred camels led by
a great company of ragged men and walking
with that insolent and foolish air which this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
beast affects and which at such a moment provoked
me to rage.</p>

<p>“Then a slave, trembling lest he should give
me offence, bade me come apart with him where
steps led up the city wall. These I climbed, and
from the summit I saw a sight that broke my
heart.</p>

<p>“For there, across the plain that surrounded
the city, came such a mass of camels as I hardly
thought the universe contained. They came in
batches of twenty, fifty, two hundred, herds and
flocks of camels, driven, led, ridden, conducted in
every shape from one direction and another,
through the desert and cultivated land, from track
and path, a very foison and cataract of camels.
It was as though all the camels of Arabia, India,
Bactria, and Syria had been summoned to this
one place.</p>

<p>“And, alas, so they had! or at least as many
as the King of that region could command....</p>

<p>“For this was the explanation....”</p>

<p>Here the old man’s eyes grew dim with tears,
his voice faltered, and in spite of his present
riches he broke down at the recollection of his
past ill-fortune.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear nephews,” he said in broken
accents, “hardly will you believe the magnitude
of my misfortune! For it turned out, as I eagerly
questioned the people of the place, that a war
having broken out against their King on account
of the Date Prohibition of which I have told you,
that ruthless monarch had ordered them to collect
as best they might so many thousands of camels
to be present within the walls by noon of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
day, or suffer massacre. If the full tale were
not present every man, woman, and child would
be killed. For he had been suddenly alarmed by
this declaration of war and caught with an insufficient
provision of sumpter beasts. His
Emirs had advised him that his salvation lay in
seizing without payment every beast for leagues
around.</p>

<p>“In proportion as my soul sank so did the
hearts of the townsmen rise, to see the number
gradually fulfilled. By noon all was well for
them—but very ill for me! The officers of the
king arrived, the beasts were counted and set
apart, with not an ounce of copper to pay for any
one of them! All seized! And my poor herd,
alone and in that vast multitude, suffered the fate
of all the rest, and, what was worse, every one of
my slaves—all were taken off to serve as drivers.</p>

<p>“There in a far land, alone, I stood, with not a
gold piece left in my pouch and not a head of
cattle to my name; once more quite destitute.</p>

<p>“I spent the remainder of that day debating
whether to hang myself on a beam or throw myself
from a minaret. The arguments in favour of
either course were so evenly balanced that the
sun set before I could decide between them, and
even at sunset there appeared, through the Mercy
of Allah, a new relief.”</p>

<p>“There did?” said the second of the nephews
eagerly, but before his uncle could reply the intolerable
noise of the Muezzin was heard and the
boys, rising at the signal, bowed low to their
uncle and were gone.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">When</span>
the nephews of Mahmoud once again
attended their uncle at the hour of public
executions he gazed at them in his benevolent
fashion, again stroking his long beard, the better
to expose the jewels upon his fingers, and continued
the tale of his fortunes.</p>

<p>“You left me, my dear children, at the end of
my last recital in a very deplorable condition.
You will remember that through the superior
business ability of a merchant renowned for his
organizing power, grasp of detail, sense of affairs,
etc., etc., etc., I had been reduced in property to
a few camels and their attendants, and that even
this poor remainder of my fortune I had lost
through a miscalculation of the camel market on
the eve of war.</p>

<p>“Your filial affection will also recall the bitter
mood in which I hesitated whether to precipitate
myself from a minaret or to hang myself from
a beam.</p>

<p>“Advantages and disadvantages appeared
equally balanced between these two courses; and
though my long training in commerce had led me
to make rapid decisions (as being the most certain
way of forestalling competitors), yet I confess
that in this debate I stood uncertain for
nearly half an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was well I did so; for in that half-hour
was manifested in a triumphant manner the
Mercy of Allah to them that fear Him.</p>

<p>“As I stood there, among strangers, without
one single coin left in the world and utterly
devoid of credit, with no knowledge even of how
I should get food upon the following day, I heard
cries and a confusion of horses’ hoofs, and saw
galloping down the street towards me a very
finely-bred grey horse, with flowing mane and a
loose bridle. It bore a noble saddle of Indian
workmanship, but no rider; while, some hundreds
yards behind, impotently ran and gesticulated
a corpulent man who, from his dress, seemed
of some wealth and consequence. My first
instinct was to catch the runaway like any beggar
and restore him to his master in hope of some
small reward; a few pence that might buy me
food that evening and lodging for one night.</p>

<p>“But the beneficent Creator soon put other
thoughts into the mind of his servant. I had
caught the horse indeed. Its panting owner had
slackened his pace and was coming towards me
in a more dignified manner—when it struck me
that the animal (which was restive) could be better
controlled were I in the saddle.</p>

<p>“I am, my dear nephews, as I have told you
three times, no horseman. My more habitual
steed is the donkey and though I have, since my
attainment to high rank, taken part in ceremonial
processions, and even in the hunting to
which His Majesty so kindly invites me, yet I
must confess to you that whenever I have to
ride <i>now</i> I take care to be provided with an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
animal not only trained in the most exact manner,
but also previously soothed with drugs.</p>

<p>“I had, however, taken to the saddle when
necessity drove me, as you have seen. And on
this occasion, although the beast was infinitely
more mettlesome than any I had yet dared to
face, I took the risk. Courage was granted to
me from on High. I scrambled into the saddle,
but found that my control of the creature was
no better than it had been when I stood at his
head.</p>

<p>“I cannot swear that, in the bewilderment of
the moment, I kept a sufficiently tight rein. I
will not even swear that the value of the opportunity
was lost on me. I certainly remember
delivering several violent kicks with either heel
into the ribs of the unquiet brute. There followed
a few minutes in which (under my direction,
I must admit) he seemed to be galloping
farther and farther away from his original master,
and at full speed down the main street of
the town. I heard cries arising behind me on
every side, and upon attempting to look round
(a difficult feat for one so unused to the saddle)
I was aware of a now considerable mob, in the
midst of which I saw the distant figure of the
horse’s wealthy owner frantically exclaiming and
gesticulating.</p>

<p>“Nothing, my dear nephews, is more foolish
than to treat generously, or even rationally, an
excited crowd of human beings. All historians
and philosophers will tell you that man in this
state is but a wild beast, to be fled or mastered
according to our abilities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>“As I had not ability to master them, then it
was clearly my duty to flee them. Moreover,
even as I urged the horse to further efforts, I
confusedly appreciated what difficulty I should
have in explaining my position, were I to attempt
to return. We thundered through the
open gate into the country outside, and by that
time I had no course but frankly to take the track
across the plain and shake off my pursuers for
ever.</p>

<p>“Admire, my dear nephews, the steps by which
Providence, when It desires to succour one of
Its favourites, will lead him through one consequence
after another until at last he stands secure
in the possession of some considerable sum of
money! Here was I, not ten minutes before, contemplating
death as the only issue from my poverty,
and now mounted on a fine steed, seated in
a saddle of price, and free to try any new
adventure.</p>

<p>“I kept my handsome mount at the gallop
until the gates were far behind me and all echo
of the confused cries of my pursuers was lost.
I checked him to a sharp trot until we had
passed the first low rise of rolling land which
hid my movements from the city. I then judged
it reasonable to proceed at a pace less trying to
the poor animal who had so befriended me. I
noted from his freshness that he could but recently
have left the stable. I did not hesitate,
though with intervals of repose, to continue all
day long to put a greater and greater distance
between myself and that unfortunate misunderstanding
which I had left behind me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>“By evening my many hours’ acquaintanceship
with my horse had increased my pride in
his possession, and I turned my mind away from
all morbid considerations of his former owner.
My only anxiety was for the night. Judge therefore
of my satisfaction when, a full hour before
the setting of the sun, I found myself, on emerging
from a considerable wood, facing the walls of
a new city, the gates of which stood about a league
away from the spot whence I had first caught
sight of it.</p>

<p>“I lingered in this pleasant pasture at the edge
of the wood, loosening my horse’s girths, unbridling
his bit, and letting him graze at large on
the delicious herbage.</p>

<p>“I reclined myself, for repose, upon that same
grass, and mused upon the distant prospect of
domes and minarets under the mellow light, my
thoughts naturally turning to conjecture what
sums I might acquire in cash from the citizens
within those walls during my enjoyment of their
hospitality.</p>

<p>“The sun was barely set when I rode into the
town; noting on the walls the usual proclamation
against the eating of dates and receiving, as
was due to one riding so well-accoutred and so
fine a horse, the respectful looks of the passersby,
and the humble but prolonged gaze of the
guard at the gate. As I noted their attitude I
could not but thank heaven for one more mercy
which was now revealed to me. Had I happened
to find this horse after some days of misfortune
my own outward appearance would have ill consorted
with his. How manifest was the dispensa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>tion
of Providence whereby I came upon him
within an hour after losing my other property,
and, therefore while I was still in my decent
merchant’s dress, cleanly, well-shaven, and
groomed!</p>

<p>“There was in the central square of this town
a runnel specially disposed for watering beasts
of burden, and my horse (we had forded but one
stream in all that day’s journey) eagerly approached
it. I fondly patted his neck and
thought with pleasure of how noble a friend I
had acquired; for as you must have read, there
is a sort of affinity between man and the horse
which readily makes them intimate after even a
short acquaintance: especially if the man be of
a business turn of mind and the horse of considerable
value.</p>

<p>“From this mood into which I had fallen while
my handsome mount was taking his simple refreshment,
you may guess the perturbation
caused me when I heard at my side an eager voice
deliberately pitched in a low key so that it might
be heard by none but myself. That voice was full
of passionate necessity, and was asking me
whether it would be possible <i>now</i>—<i>here</i>—<i>at once</i>,
for me to dispose of my mount to a man whose
life depended on it.</p>

<p>“I turned and made out in the dusk under the
shadow of his cowl (part of which he had pulled
over his features to make a sort of veil) a young
man whose agitation made me yearn instinctively
to take some advantage of him.</p>

<p>“‘Sir,’ he whispered hurriedly, ‘my request is
not only impertinent but extraordinary. I know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
that you will not understand it. I can only implore
Heaven for a miracle. My time is very
short. I know not how far my pursuers may be.
My life is dear to me and still dearer is my
honour. The night is falling. Here is my opportunity,
which, if I do not take, all is over with
me.’</p>

<p>“He thereupon passed up to me a leather bag
upon opening which I could see in the fading
light a quantity of gold pieces, and he accompanied
the gesture with so imploring a look as
explained the vastness of his offer.</p>

<p>“Had I passed through any series of adventures
less astonishing than those of the last day
and night, I would not have listened for a
moment to a first proposal. I would have attempted,
as was indeed my duty, to raise his
price, to obtain immediately some of his apparel
as well as his purse; and if possible a written
promise of further payment as well. For he was
distraught with fear and men in that condition
are easily squeezed. But the rate at which I had
been living, the perpetual succession, first of unfortunate
and then of fortunate accidents, showed
the manifest finger of God in all that had so far
favoured me since the morning, and strangely
convinced me. Without another word I took the
bag of gold and dismounted.</p>

<p>“The young man, with a new expression such
as I had never yet seen upon anyone’s face, said
not a word, no, not even of gratitude to his benefactor;
turned the horse’s head down the main
street of the town, wisely refraining from too
rapid an exit lest his passage should be remem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>bered,
and went at no more than a sharp trot
through the gate into the falling darkness without.
The last I saw of him he appeared, a dark figure
rapidly dwindling against the darkening sky,
framed in the tiled horseshoe of the Bab-El-Soued....
But even as I gazed a troop of mounted
horsemen thundered past me and passed through
that same gate into the night.</p>

<p>“For my part I thought no more of him, but
turned back to the centre of the town. There I
was, with three times the price of my horse in my
pocket, and thus with solid ground on which to
stand for the future.</p>

<p>“My first care was to make an excellent meal,
my next to discover a good lodging for the night.
In both I was fortunate. But before reciting my
last evening prayers I took the precaution of
informing a passing patrol that I had had a horse
stolen from me; for, in business, no opportunity
should be neglected. I then recommended myself
to the Divine protection and fell into a sweet
repose.</p>

<p>“Next morning, after I had humbly and
devoutly recited my early prayers, I thought I
would, before proceeding to any lucrative task,
divert myself a little so that I might later
approach serious business with a more open mind.</p>

<p>“It is my custom, when I am in need of recreation
from the cares of commerce, to frequent the
criminal courts and to attend the sentences passed
upon those brought before them, as well as to be
a spectator of the ensuing executions. No pastime
affords greater relief from the dull, everyday
round of buying and selling; while the contrast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
between one’s own pleasant position and that of
the pauper who is to be beheaded, adds a zest
which I recommend to all men of affairs.</p>

<p>“I strolled, therefore, to the court in which I
had heard that certain criminals were to be
that morning briefly examined and presumably
dispatched.</p>

<p>“Great was my surprise upon entering to find
that I had come just in time to hear the last
evidence given and sentence pronounced upon the
same young man who had so imprudently bought
my horse the night before! Did I say ‘imprudently’?—Well!
The designs of Providence are
hidden from us, and it is not for me to judge
another!... While I pitied him, therefore, I
had nothing to reproach myself with, for I had
fulfilled in the most honourable fashion the only
contract with which I was concerned in the matter.
The pursuers had arrested him before he had
left the city more than a mile. He stood accused
of eating dates: a practice (you will remember)
forbidden throughout all those dominions. He
had been seen in the act by the Sultan’s officers a
week before and his name and description had
been sent round to every city. Indeed a troop
was hot upon his trail at the moment he had
come up the night before imploring for my mount.
Sentence was pronounced, and the unfortunate
young man was led out to execution.</p>

<p>“My natural love of such sights would have
led me to follow him, when one more act of
Heaven (I dare not ascribe the inspiration to my
poor unaided soul) suddenly put an exceedingly
valuable thought into my mind. I addressed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
judge in a loud voice, complaining in the matter
of my horse. At first he was disturbed and
inclined to silence me, not understanding what
plea I could have in this particular case; but I
made bold to arrest his attention and told him that
the evidence I had chanced to hear proved clearly
that the horse on which the unfortunate young
man had tried to escape was one stolen from me
but a few hours before. This I was prepared to
prove. The officers of the court were examined
and admitted my description to be exact as to the
horse, and, what was a clinching piece of evidence,
as to the details of the saddle, the workmanship
of which they had noted.</p>

<p>“I informed the judge further that I had ridden
into the town the evening before. I was prepared
to bring witnesses from the guard at the gate who
had seen me pass. And when these were
summoned they agreed that I had entered riding
a horse of the description I had just given. I
could see that the judge inclined to the justice
of my plea; the officers of the court naturally fell
in with his mood; I made him, I think, the more
gracious by my assurance that I would not dream
of making too exact a claim. If the animal were
but restored to me I should be satisfied, nor would
I ask anything for dilapidation or loss of time. I
was only too glad (I said) to have been of the
most insignificant service to the court.</p>

<p>“The judge now smiled upon me with evident
approval, and was further confirmed in his decision
by remembering that even if I claimed any
compensation it would not come out of his pocket
but the public’s; and I have no doubt that this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
argument, though not explicitly put forward, was
present in the minds of all the officers of the court
as well. The judge therefore ordered that the
animal should be restored to me, and was pleased
to use the following words. They are not my own.
I am not responsible for them. But I am glad
that he used them.</p>

<p>“‘This honest merchant,’ said he, ‘who has
given a very clear account of his movements, we
are in some fashion beholden to, on account of the
temporary loss which he has suffered in the filching
of his mount by the criminal with whom we
have just dealt. He was indirectly the cause of
that criminal’s arrest. The least we can do,
therefore, is to give him his property back with
the least possible delay. I order that the animal
with all his accoutrements, having first been
properly fed and groomed, shall be restored to
him.’</p>

<p>“I very humbly bowed and thanked the court
for its just decision. But a new complication
arose.</p>

<p>“The chief officer of the court, the captain of
those who had arrested the young man (he had
by this time lost his head, so that there was no
trouble to be feared from <i>that</i> side), conferred
with his colleagues and then prostrated himself
upon the earth before the judge, begging to be
allowed an explanation. The judge assumed a
disturbed expression and bade him be brief. He
arose and admitted with evident grief that the
horse, in the excitement of the arrest, and in the
darkness of the moment (for all this had passed
in the night), had got loose and was lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Seeing the rising anger of the judge I hastily
intervened. I said that I yielded to no one in my
admiration for the Mounted Police of the Anti-Date
force, the renown of whose efficiency had
reached me even in my own distant land. I said
that I would be the last to cause the least injustice
or even pain. I begged that his Importance (for
such was the simple title of a judge in that
country) would overlook the unfortunate accident
whereby my horse had been lost. I concluded
by saying that I would be perfectly content with
what we merchants called ‘a minimum valuation,’
that is, a payment of the price the horse would
have fetched from what we merchants also call ‘a
willing seller.’ In a phrase of which I confess I
was secretly proud, I hinted that the doing of
justice in this matter would not only be of no
charge to the court, but even of some profit to
them, seeing that there were certain to be fees of
transfer, registration, and what not. As a layman
I was ignorant of their amount, but I knew them
to be attached to such affairs—all out of the taxes.</p>

<p>“The judge, the officers of the court, and every
lawyer present, the very sweepers were moved to
action. Sundry papers were signed (to which I
put the name of Ali—it was the first that occurred
to me). I was paid the sum of thirty pieces of
gold, and after profound obeisances to all present,
and especially to my benefactor the judge, I left
the court, yet richer than I had entered it.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“My children, what next?</p>

<p>“It is a universal rule in commerce to follow
your profits and cut your losses, and men of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
profession have a sort of instinct which tells them
how long the tide will be flowing with them and
when it will turn. I decided that there was yet
one more step for me to take.</p>

<p>“The arrest had taken place not far from the
edge of the wood whence I had first perceived the
city. There my horse, the evening before, had
found good pasture. There had I loosened his
saddle. There had he known an excellent place
of repose. Thither did I wisely suppose my lost
friend to have repaired. I sauntered therefore
out of the city as though engaged upon no more
than a stroll, and sure enough, a league away,
under the trees which afforded a grateful shade,
the noble beast was reclining, hampered only by
his saddle.</p>

<p>“I loosened the girths. He was grateful, and
our friendship was renewed. But though my
affection was increased by such a recovery, I
steeled my heart for what I purposed next to do.</p>

<p>“It is a maxim of all sound business that a thing
should be sold as often as possible, and it was
clear that I now had an opportunity of selling this
charming creature for the third time. It was
equally clear that, if I delayed, the opportunity
would pass; for the story of my appearance in
court would spread through the city, the officers
would talk with their friends about the saddle
and the description of the animal; I might even
get into a difficult tangle with the authorities.</p>

<p>“But the whole of this propitious day was in the
hand of Heaven. For, while yet the sun was
high, there came upon me through the pasture a
shepherd driving his sheep, and to him I told a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
tale that I had been sent by my master to sell the
horse I was leading, and his saddle, to a certain
dealer, who had already seen them and bargained
for them. I had been given a writing with the
name of the dealer in the neighbouring city, but I
had lost the writing and could not remember the
name or direction.</p>

<p>“The shepherd told me that he only went to
that city from time to time, but he was well
acquainted with it; the purchaser could be none
other than Abd-ul-Eblis.</p>

<p>“The moment he pronounced this name I
clapped my hands together and said: ‘Abd-ul-Eblis!
That was the name!’ I thanked the
shepherd for thus refreshing my memory, and I
carefully walked by the beast’s side as should a
mere servant by his master’s precious possession.
I avoided the main gate (which I had now passed
twice and where I might be too well known) and
entered the city by a little postern. I found from
inquiry of a blind man—which was the more
prudent—the way to Abd-ul-Eblis’s stables.</p>

<p>“I made no plan of what I should do, for on
those days when I am specially favoured by the
Most High I leave His Power to guide me ...
and to guide also those with whom I do business.
I went no farther than to tell the groom that I
had come to find a purchaser for the horse—not
indeed in this city, where I had been told the
market was poor, but in a place two days’ journey
away, where the news of the famous beast’s
coming had already been spread. I then wandered
out into the streets to take the cool air of the
evening. It was as I had expected. When I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
returned to see that my horse had been well fed,
Abd-ul-Eblis was present in the stable and eager
to deal.</p>

<p>“He pointed out to me the advantages he
enjoyed for disposing of horses, the dangers of
the distant journey of which I had spoken to the
groom, the possibility of what is called in the
language of that country ‘a proposition.’ He
showed me what, in my innocence, I might have
forgotten, that it was not as though the horse was
my own. That <i>I</i> could only be a gainer. That
my master would be none the wiser. That I might
pretend any accident to have taken place (for
indeed such an accident was likely if I went on
farther). He also was at the pains of repeating
what I might have forgotten, that I was free to
retain for myself some portion of the price,
assuring me that he would keep silent upon the
matter. In the end I promised to hand him over
the horse for sixty pieces of gold.</p>

<p>“There are some men, my dear nephews, who
even in these circumstances would have begun
bargaining for a higher price. These are men
who love the making of small sums and who do not
understand the enormous weight of caprice and
chance in human affairs. So far from attempting
to get a higher price, I expressed my gratitude
and said that for my part I was quite willing to
take less, but that I somewhat feared my master’s
anger and could not return to him without at
least fifty pieces of gold, adding that I considered
ten pieces a sufficient reward for myself. At the
same time I advised Abdul not to sell the saddle
<i>with</i> the horse, nor did I omit to remind him that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
horses of a light colour are more easily dyed than
those of a darker hue.</p>

<p>“At these suggestions of mine he looked upon
me mournfully for a few moments and then slowly
counted out sixty pieces of gold. I took a long
farewell of the kindly, patient, and beautiful
animal, which had borne me to this fortune in the
short space of one day, and then walked forth
through the city into the evening, preferring the
chance of a lodging in the forest to tempting
further the singular Fate that had so far
befriended me.</p>

<p>“The weather was warm, the neighbouring
wood, as I knew by experience, hospitable. There
would I spend the few hours of darkness, building
myself a small fire to keep off the beasts and to
cherish me. Thence, I did not doubt, I could the
next morning, with now so satisfactory a capital,
proceed to the re-edification of my fortune.</p>

<p>“I reached the wooded hill which overlooked
the city. I recited my third night prayers. Before
building my fire and disposing myself to sleep, I
looked at the outline of the walls and domes and
graceful minarets against the last of the evening,
and I revolved in my mind that thought which
shall ever be mine on my departure from any town.
Let it also be yours, my dear children, in all your
travels.</p>

<p>“For just as when you come to a new city of a
morning, before you enter it, and after having
prayed God, you should muse within yourself
what sums of money you may hope to lift from
its inhabitants; so when you leave any city at
evening, never omit (after due thanks to your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Creator!) to calculate what sums you have indeed
subtracted from those to whom you bid farewell.”</p>

<p>As the old merchant ceased it was like the
ending of a strain of solemn music, the echoes of
which linger and continue in the memory. The
strangely moving words he had uttered stirred a
profound in the depths of their young souls, and
they sat with bowed heads until the horrid outrage
of the Muezzin’s call murdered that sacred silence.</p>

<p>At the signal the lads rose and filed out on tiptoe
leaving their uncle with his eyes closed and his
lips murmuring in prayer.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
  <small>ENTITLED <i>AL-WALI</i>, OR THE HOLY ONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">When</span>
the hour of public executions had
arrived (they were more numerous than
usual) his young nephews respectfully assembled
at the feet of the aged millionaire and received
the further account of his fortunes.</p>

<p>“You might imagine, my children,” he began
“that having this small capital so happily
furnished me by Providence in the short space of
a single day, I would again venture upon a
commercial undertaking. That would have been
indeed my natural course; but you must remember
that I could not, without great danger, enter the
city I had just left, lest my able transactions
should lead me into contact with those at whose
expense they had been conducted. Further, I was
in a strange country with no knowledge of my
way and with nothing to guide me save the happy
circumstance that I was still within the boundaries
of our holy religion. Most of those I should meet
would thus be True Believers, whose frailties I
could better understand than those of the Kafir,
and of whom therefore I could (under the all-powerful
guidance of Heaven) more easily take
advantage.</p>

<p>“Devoutly remembering the signal mercies
shown to me by Allah in this last short day, I
determined to follow the same course as I had
when my good fortune came to me—to lie passive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
under the Mighty Hand directing me and to trust
to luck.</p>

<p>“I took some sleep in the night beside my fire,
but hardly had I awakened at dawn when I was
aware of a group approaching me through the
forest track. They were a party of a dozen or so,
half of them on foot, half of them mounted; of no
great consequence if one might judge by their
clothing, which, my dear nephews, is in most
occasions in life the signal by which we may know
whether to revere men or to despise them. Both
beasts and humans in this group were travel-stained
as having come from some great distance.</p>

<p>“As I saw them before they saw me, I naturally
took the precaution of creeping up behind them
through the trees in order to overhear the object
of their journey. It appeared that they were
bound on pilgrimage to the shrine of a Most Holy
Man, to obtain his oracle in a matter which
concerned their miserable village.</p>

<p>“My mind was at once made up. I ran back
by a circuitous course through the trees, came to
a place ahead of their progress, and there, spreading
my little mat upon the sward, I prostrated
myself in prayer. Indeed, I was thus able to kill
two birds with one stone, for I had not yet said
those morning prayers of the True Believer which
I had never omitted in all my life, save when I
happened to be flying from justice and therefore
deprived of leisure.</p>

<p>“As I heard them coming up behind me I raised
my head and voice at once, and fell into a perfect
ecstasy of worship, which did not fail to impress
the simple mountaineers. They halted respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>fully
until I saw fit to terminate my conversation
with the Most High. I pretended to be so absorbed
in my contemplation of divine things as not to
notice them: for to keep them waiting secured
religious as well as worldly respect. They
approached me with deference and even awe. I
told them I was bound for the shrine of a Most
Holy Man whose name I gave them. They were
overjoyed to discover that they had a companion
filled with the same sentiments as themselves.</p>

<p>“‘We also,’ said their leader, ‘are engaged
upon the same sacred mission. For we have been
informed by a messenger (whom we dispatched
a month ago from our village) that the Saint will
graciously receive us and give us a reply upon a
doubtful matter of wild hedge-pigs which has
greatly excited our tribe, whether they be pork or
no.’</p>

<p>“I let them convey by chance phrases the direction
we had to travel and the distance of our goal.
I was delighted to discover that our way did not
lie through the city, and that we might hope to
reach the Holy One before night.</p>

<p>“The journey was tedious, passing over burnt
land with but a few wretched villages upon the
track; but by the late afternoon we could see far
off, coloured by the declining rays of the sun, a
small, white-domed building, the tomb of a great
saint long dead, by the side of which a large group
of tents and a considerable assembly lying out in
the open round them cooking their evening meal,
beasts of burden, and all the movement of a camp,
showed us that we were reaching the term of our
day’s journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>“When we reached the camp I joined the
thickest part of the throng, separating from the
group with which I had been marching. I made
my evening prayers in as conspicuous a place as
possible, prolonged them prodigiously, the better
to impress my new neighbours, and then lay down,
uncertain what the course of the next day should
be.</p>

<p>“It was revealed to me in a dream.</p>

<p>“In that dream there appeared a bright and
beneficent Being who with one hand was relieving
of his superfluous wealth an unconscious pilgrim
to his left, and with the other was conferring
precisely the same favour on another to his right.
Each of the two pilgrims had his face turned away
from the Blessed Genius thus engaged and seemed
unconscious of the process to which he was
subjected. The Glorious Visitant, without interrupting
its occupation or ceasing with mechanical
regularity to dip its hands into the pouches of
its unwitting neighbours, looked upon me with the
most benign expression, winked, and disappeared.</p>

<p>“I awoke. It was yet dark. I pondered until
dawn what the revelation might mean. With the
rising of the sun inner as well as outer light was
bestowed upon me. I interpreted in the following
fashion the vision that had thus been vouchsafed
to me and the event proved me to have divined the
right reading by interpretation:</p>

<p>“In every place largely frequented by pilgrims
you will, my dear nephews (if your commercial
pursuits lead you to such spots in after life),
discover two kinds of men. There are those who
have already spent their all under the influence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
of the Spirit and are about to depart. These,
being in a necessity to raise a viaticum for their
return, will eagerly convert into cash at a vile
price such wretched objects as remain to them.
On the other hand, those arriving are flush of
money and eager to acquire holy relics and memorials
of the blessed days before them.</p>

<p>“With two such markets before one’s eyes and
clamouring for exploitation, all that is required
is a little judgment upon which is which, who is
who, and what is what. Such a judgment is essential
to any commercial success, but especially to
success with people in a state of religious exaltation.
For whereas this mood often conduces to
folly, it sometimes so supernaturally brightens the
intellectual faculties of devotees as to procure
most cruel rebuffs for him who attempts to take
advantage of it.</p>

<p>“I mixed with my fellow-worshippers. I picked
out those whom I judged from their anxious
expression, coupled with their preparations for
a journey, to be eager sellers. From these I
acquired at prices quite surprisingly small, all
manner of objects—sticks, chaplets, sandals,
water-bottles, rags, and cords—while I dexterously
sheered off the few who seemed too much
inclined to bargain, and whom not even a
prolonged residence at the shrine had wholly
purged of avarice. The remainder were quite
sufficient for my needs.</p>

<p>“With a stock thus acquired at the expenditure
of not a tenth of my capital, I next proceeded to
mix with the more prosperous newcomers, pressing
on them now one object and now another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
(sandals, lace, rags, bits of bone and leather),
as somethings of peculiar sanctity, either as dedicated
to the shrine of the Dead Holy Man or as
having touched the person of the Living One. I
discovered a very brisk market indeed, at prices
varying from a hundred to a thousand times the
original cost of the rubbish. To each bit of rag,
bone, or what not I was careful to affix a pedigree
written in various hands and proving it authentic.</p>

<p>“In these negotiations I was careful, at the
least note of suspicion, to pretend a complete
indifference; and to one or two more than usually
guileful I even made the sacrifice of giving a yard
of used cord or a hopelessly worn sandal, remarking
as I did so that Sacred Things should not be
made a matter of traffic.</p>

<p>“In this fashion I passed four days so absorbed
in the interest of the occupation that I quite forgot
(it was an error on my part) to present myself
within the clamouring line of those who daily
demanded the opportunity to fall down before the
object of our pilgrimage and to offer him obeisance.
It was a mistake which nearly cost me dear,
for the Holy Man had his hired watchers among
the crowd.</p>

<p>“On the evening of the fourth day, as I was
privately counting my gains under a secluded
bush where I hoped to be unobserved, I was
disturbed by a smart tap upon the shoulder and a
summons from an aged but tall and still strong
man, armed with a formidable bludgeon. This
person bade me follow him without comment, and
told me I had been granted the singular favour
of personal access to The Master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was with mixed feelings that I accompanied
my guide. We elbowed our way through the foremost
ranks of worshippers to that inmost place
wherein the Holy One communed with his Creator.
They envied me and gazed with awe upon one so
privileged, but for my part my heart sank lower
and lower, and I waited in something approaching
panic the interview that had been so graciously
afforded.</p>

<p>“I was introduced through a curtain into a low
hut, wholly devoid of ornament, built of dried
mud and lit only by two small smoky lamps that
stood upon the floor. I dimly perceived before me
in this half-darkness the figure of a very aged
man, incredibly emaciated with prolonged fast
and vigil. He was upon his knees with a chaplet
in his hands. His eyes were cast upon the ground,
which his long but sparse white beard almost
touched. He seemed oblivious to all the external
world, and was plunged in profound communion
with his Maker.</p>

<p>“The attendant in low but angry whispers bade
me prostrate myself, which I was not slow in
doing; and in that posture I waited for a space
of time so tedious that it seemed to me the greater
part of one hour. But during all that time I
dared not move; for though I had never visited
this particular shrine, I had heard tales of what
had happened to those who underrate the Unseen
Powers. I was relieved at last by a distinct and
hollow voice bidding me in measured tones to
rise. I arose, and found that we were alone. The
attendants had been dismissed by a gesture while
my face was yet buried on the ground, and though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
I have no doubt that they were within earshot, I
suffered the added awe of loneliness.</p>

<p>“The Holy One still maintained for a moment
his impassive attitude of prayer, then slowly
pivoted round on his knees, turned his luminous
eyes upon me, and sternly asked me what profit
I had made by my infamous trade during the last
few days. I felt that all was known to him. I did
not (I thank Heaven for its mercies!) attempt to
deceive him and thus jeopardize my life and
reason. I told him the full tale and awaited his
sentence.</p>

<p>“There was a long pause, during which what
little was left of my courage ebbed away. I felt
prepared to hear some short sentence of doom
and resigned myself to my fate. But I had happily
miscalculated the serene wisdom which accompanies
holiness.</p>

<p>“The Saint spoke next in a more benevolent and
softer voice, bade me be seated cross-legged before
him, and adopting the same attitude pronounced
the following remarkable words:</p>

<p>“‘The Just, the Merciful (Whose name be
exalted!), has given to different men different
aptitudes. The fool attempts that of which he
is incapable. The wise man recognizes his
limitations.’</p>

<p>“In the silence that followed I turned these
weighty phrases over in my mind and recognized
excerpts from the Proverbs of Mar-Hakim, whose
wisdom has been collected by the Persians, and
has been famous since the times of the second
Omar.</p>

<p>“After a short interval the voice continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘In mutual appreciation and in mutual benefits
each acquires profit. The short-sighted forfeit
advantage by too much grasping.’</p>

<p>“These words, which were chanted rather than
said, I recognized to be from a totally different
collection of popular sayings, formerly current in
Arabia, and reduced to writing in the first century
of Hegira by the learned of Rasht. It was clear
that I was in the presence of a man unusually
well-informed, and my conviction was confirmed
when after yet another solemn pause the voice
continued as though in conclusion:</p>

<p>“‘In acquiring money there is profit, but in
letting it slip there is none at all.’</p>

<p>“This last jewel of wisdom I immediately
recalled as part of yet another collection, to wit,
the Sacred Books of the Jews; and from this
further example of immense erudition my estimation
of the Being possessed of it arose to the
clouds.</p>

<p>“After such a preface I might have expected
further general statements of a moral nature from
my host, when suddenly I perceived a total change
in the tones of his voice and a similar change in
his attitude. He put off the preoccupation of
religion. He took on the tone of familiar intercourse
proper to temporal affairs. He smiled
genially and entered upon a conversation such as
one might enjoy in the bazaar of any city or in
the private hospitality of any merchant.</p>

<p>“‘There are some,’ he said, ‘who would have
blamed your conduct; and in a sense I do so; for I
cannot excuse your passage of four whole days
without a thought of heaven. But then, we are all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
agreed that the driving of a trade, especially if
it be remarkably rapid and lucrative, is a very
worthy occupation, and it is one of my regrets
that my professional devotion to the Other World
has curtailed my own activities in the same line.</p>

<p>“‘I am visited by thousands of respectful
worshippers. The small amounts of alms which
they graciously leave with my treasurer might
easily be increased by various commercial
activities.</p>

<p>“‘Indeed, I have from time to time attempted
to establish such in this camp, but I regret to say
with no success. I opened a canteen here but two
years ago where refreshments were sold to the
new arrivals at from three to five times their
value. But the evil servant to whom I entrusted
the management of this concern decamped with
the whole of the profits. I obtained the satisfaction
of having him put to death by a distant friend,
but I was never able to recover his ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p>“‘At another time I entered into a contract
with certain brigands who hold the passes of the
mountains. It was clearly understood between us
that they should hold up the worshippers returning
from my shrine and that one-half of the
ransoms they collected should be paid into my
chests. But from that day to this I have not
received a penny.</p>

<p>“‘On yet another occasion it occurred to me
that I might fix a regular tribute to replace the
voluntary alms which, though considerable, leave
room for improvement. But the alarming falling
off in receipts and the dwindling of my income<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
made me withdraw the order within six months of
its issue.</p>

<p>“‘All these experiences combined, my dear
Mahmoud,’ said he familiarly (thus showing that
he knew my true name and disturbing me not a
little), ‘have convinced me that I have not what
you men of affairs call “a business sense.” I
may have a latent talent, I may even have a
genius, for religion. When I tell you that I sometimes
pass three days without changing my
position of prayer and without taking food
or drink, the whole performance watched by a
great crowd of astonished faithful, you will agree
that I am not without capabilities of my own. But
I am reluctantly convinced that what the Giaours
call “a good nose for a deal” is not one of them.’</p>

<p>“Here I began to interrupt him with the usual
compliments, and would have assured him that
any man of ability had but to train himself for
affairs to do as well as another, when he genially
stopped me with a gesture and said:</p>

<p>“‘No, my dear Mahmoud’ (again the use of my
name disturbed me), ‘whatever else we are let us
not be hypocrites. Let us frankly acknowledge
our limitations. You, as I am now convinced,
know how to sell and to buy, and have all the
qualities for discovering the dearest and the
cheapest markets. Much as I have desired to
attain to the same faculties I have failed, and at
my age (which, though it is not the 110 years
reported, is at any rate well over sixty) it is too
late to change. I will therefore make you what is
called, I believe, in your world, an offer.’</p>

<p>“(With what relief did those words fall on my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
ears! I did not realize for the moment how
greatly it was to his advantage to have begun
by frightening your unhappy uncle and what an
opportunity this had given him for negotiations!)</p>

<p>“‘I will make you a proposition. Think carefully
over it, and at the end of a reasonable time
give me your decision. I offer you two alternatives.
The one is that you should continue your
trade subject to the supervision of my agents, and
that when you have reached a total of 1,000 pieces
of gold you shall be impaled and the money
confiscated. The other is that you shall continue
to use your evident talents for the furtherance
of this trade, but that I shall be regarded as a
sleeping partner in the same, with half the
takings. The choice lies with you.... Pray,
pray take your time. Undue haste has spoilt many
an excellent business contract, and I would not
have you ruin your chances. Do not,’ he continued,
repressing my evident anxiety to accept his terms,
‘do not let your judgment be prejudiced by any
feeling of obligation. Think the alternatives over
carefully and then let me know your conclusion.
Take your time.’</p>

<p>“Restraining too great an evidence of haste, I
told him that my mind was already made up and
that I would be honoured to accept his second
offer.</p>

<p>“‘I think, Mahmoud,’ said he, rising, ‘that you
have acted with wisdom, though perhaps with a
little precipitation. Let us, then, regard the
matter as settled. Every evening my servants
will call upon you for one-half of your takings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
and they meanwhile will protect you in every
way.’</p>

<p>“I prostrated myself once more, kissed the
ground at his feet, and left the hut in a very
different mood from that in which I had entered it.</p>

<p>“I remained in the camp for the matter of about
a month. I extended my operations; and every
evening the servants of the Holy One attended me
and I handed over half of my takings. During
the whole of that period my capital continued to
increase prodigiously.</p>

<p>“But no good endures for ever. The time came
when this even tenor was threatened in a very
unexpected way.</p>

<p>“The Holy One was visited by certain ambassadors
from the Grand Something or Other residing
in the court of the Caliph, who informed him
that his position was duly recognized by the
authorities, and that they bore with them an
Illuminated Charter confirming it. The temporal
advantages of His Holiness’s trade, however,
were no less clearly evident to the Caliph than
the religious ones, and His Holiness would therefore
be good enough in future to hand over
one-half of his receipts to the Imperial Treasury.</p>

<p>“Heaven knows with what bitterness the Holy
Man agreed; which, having done, he sent for me
again and told me that it was now necessary for
him to ask me for three-fourths of my receipts.
In vain did I point out to him that all great
empires had fallen by the increase of taxation.
He was adamant, and I therefore reluctantly
agreed to the new arrangement; taking a solemn
oath to observe it for at least one year. But I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
asked him whether at the expiration of that time,
in case I should find the new bargain more than I
could support, I might depart out of the city? To
this he agreed, and confirmed it with an oath
equally solemn.</p>

<p>“That night I put together all my accumulated
wealth (which now filled not less than four large
bags with gold and silver) and charging it upon
the mule of a peculiarly devout and therefore
unobservant and abstracted pilgrim, and drawing
the innocent beast away in the darkness by the
bridle, I left the camp as slowly and cautiously
as I might.</p>

<p>“Emissaries were sent out to kill me within
half an hour of my departure. As I heard their
approach I turned my mule round towards the
camp as though I were arriving, and as they
passed me, I said I was a pilgrim who had lost
his way in the night and asked if I were on the
right road for the shrine. This simple ruse
deceived them. They went their way and I was
alone once more. Still, their passage sufficiently
alarmed me. I gave up the road for a less
frequented path and wandered all that night
through an unfamiliar district, for my poor beast
could go no faster than a walking pace, so heavy
were the bags of treasure which he bore.</p>

<p>“By dawn I felt myself secure, and——”</p>

<p>But here the Old Gentleman heard the first
intolerable note of the Muezzin and stopped short,
motioning to his nephews that they should leave
him, which they did with their customary humility,
each wondering in his heart whether he might not
later feel a vocation to the Religious Life.</p>

  <small>ENTITLED <i>AL-MAHALLAT AL-JADIDA</i>, <br />OR THE NEW QUARTER OF THE CITY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">“As</span>
I proceeded the next morning across
the waste” (continued Mahmoud to his
nephews on their next visit) “I turned over in my
mind how best to employ the considerable sum
which my honest mule bore so patiently upon his
back. Here was a year’s sustenance for fifty
labourers or more, and with so much money a
man earns more. For, as it is written in the Holy
Book, ‘<i>The labourer is worthy of his hire, but
whatever is over is not for him</i>.’ And again,
‘<i>Blessed are the poor</i>.’</p>

<p>“There are not wanting occasions for the
employment of poorer men and the gathering of
the fruits of their labour into one’s own pouch.
But there is one difficulty in all such matters,
which is the point of judgment.</p>

<p>“You will recollect (my dear nephews) how
often in the past a most careful investment of
mine had gone wrong, and how often a mere
hazard, not even of my own choosing, had brought
me sudden fortune. How in the matter of the
sheep I was beaten almost to death by the market-police,
while in the matter of the horse I had
sold, three times over, an animal that had cost
me nothing and had fallen to me by the pure
goodness of God. How in the matter of the dates
I had been left penniless by a man of greater
Business Sense, Foresight, Organizing Ability,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Eye for the Market, Knowledge of Men, and the
rest of the virtues; while in the Matter of the
Holy Man I had—as my weary mule proved—done
extremely well out of a quite unexpected accident.
Even as this last example passed through my mind
I remembered, for the first time, that the mule
himself was a new accession of fortune, over and
above the silver he carried. For I had not had
the inconvenience of paying for him. He was a
fine beast, and in spite of his fatigue still looked
well bred. I estimated him at quite ten pieces of
gold, and mentally added that sum on my tablets
to the total value of my possessions.</p>

<p>“It was so musing that I found myself
approaching a high tangle of reeds, through which
a narrow path wound and was lost to view. On
this path I engaged. The reeds on either side
were so tall as to hide the farther landscape, and
so closely set that one could see but a few yards
into their mass.</p>

<p>“After perhaps an hour of such journeying my
mule and I came out suddenly upon the firm bank
of a broad and shallow river whose noise and
coolness, swift current and clear stream were a
delight after so many hours of arid travel. There
did I sit me down. There did I unload and hobble
my patient companion. There did we drink of
the good water, and there did the mule eat plentifully
of cool grass. But I made no meal, for the
oat-cakes and cheese which I had taken from the
Common Table of the Poor in the Pilgrims’ camp
were now exhausted.</p>

<p>“It was this circumstance which made me a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
little anxious for the day. I looked about me,
stood up on the highest part of the bank, and then
saw that the shore opposite had been artificially
heightened to form a regular levee or embankment,
beyond which the flat country was hidden.
I determined to seek this point of advantage for
a view. I reloaded my mule, carefully forded the
stream in its various branches and climbed to the
farther shore.</p>

<p>“At the summit of the embankment, which was
evidently of recent construction, my effort was
well rewarded, for I saw a sight that set at rest
all anxiety for food and shelter.</p>

<p>“The embankment on which I stood swept round
in a horseshoe shape—not everywhere finished,
but everywhere traced out. It thus enclosed a
peninsula, bounded by the river: a space of
marshy ground full of stagnant pools and water-grasses.
Three or four furlongs away, cutting
across the whole neck of the horseshoe of swamp
and stretching from the river to the river again,
ran the well-built stone wall of a strong town, the
flat roofs and low domes of which (it had no tower
or minaret) made a ridge of snow-white against
the intense blue of the sky. Far away beyond
were distant mountains, purple in the heat.</p>

<p>“Scattered over the swamp itself and on the
unfinished sections of the embankment were
groups of labourers working with spades and
barrows, and, overseeing them, nearby to me, a
young man of energetic carriage, well dressed in
a brown garment, rich, but suitable to his work
and girded. He had no sandals, for they would
have impeded him on such ground; he bore an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
inlaid ebon staff with an ivory hand-grasp, and
was occupied, when I first saw him, in shouting a
new order to a distant group of diggers. His
back was towards me. He had not seen my
approach.</p>

<p>“As he turned, to proceed along the levee
towards another group, he caught sight of my
mule and myself and at once started to run, pouring
out when he had reached us a mixed flood of
greetings, warnings, and varied exclamations.</p>

<p>“‘We were to beware of the embankment! It
was but just raised and was not yet stable! Was
it not a fine work? Half-completed, as we saw it,
it had taken but three months. Did I notice how
thoroughly it had cut off the river? Had I not
found it firm as I came up it from the bank?
Would I be pleased to go carefully lest the edge
should be injured? ... and so on.</p>

<p>“It was clear from such a salutation with what
sort of man I had to deal. Here was an Enthusiast.
It is a character of the utmost service to
the Man of Affairs. He was of that sort which
is labelled in our indexes as ‘The Constructive
Wild Man,’ and happy is the Captain of Industry
who chances upon such a one. He was perhaps
thirty years of age, strong, short in stature, very
dark in complexion, with steady but eager eyes,
and such an expression of grasp, resolution, and
immediate decision as should lead to a fortune,
not perhaps for himself but at least for anyone
who knew how to use him; for he was as keen
as a boy upon the matter occupying him, and
therefore careless for the moment of all other
things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>“I answered him with a mixture of sympathy,
caution, and gravity, which I was glad to see
impressed him. I praised his work vaguely but
courteously enough. I asked the names of the
river and the town, and also his own. All these
he gave me; and then asked me whether I would
not share the mid-day meal he was about to take.
I said I should be overjoyed to do so: and so I
was, for I saw the prospect of refreshment at the
charges of another, an opportunity, which remember—my
dear nephews—is never to be neglected
by men of clear commercial judgment.</p>

<p>“He led me, followed by the mule, to a shady
place where a few trees stood on a drier part
of the enclosed plain. There we found excellent
meats, and there we reclined for above an hour,
during the whole of which he did not cease to
overwhelm me with description, praise, and prospect
of the great enterprise in which he was
wholly absorbed.</p>

<p>“This horseshoe bend, he told me, outside his
native town, had never been utilized. It was
flooded in the spring when the snow melted on the
distant hills; the rest of the year it was a mixture
of dry cracked mud and marsh, breeding
fever, full of insects and ill-airs at evening. He
had been left an orphan and was apprenticed to
a maker of mill-wheels, such as were used in the
stream above the city. One day the idea had
occurred to him that such instruments could be
used not only for the grinding of corn but for the
raising of water from ditches and therefore for
draining.</p>

<p>“With that his grand project had rushed into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
his mind. Why should not the marsh, which had
so far been so serious a trouble, be turned to the
profit of the city? An embankment would keep
out floods, drains cut through the enclosed marsh
would collect the water and dry the whole. These
drains could be regularly pumped out by wheels
which the outer stream would turn, and a large
area of good land would be added to the crowded
town. On this new buildings could be raised and
gardens laid out, to the great profit of all the citizens.
For the city was increasing in importance,
people were flocking in, there was crowding and
difficulty and high rents, yet no place over which
to expand between the marsh and the hills.</p>

<p>“He had approached the council and headmen
with this project. They had hesitated long. At
last they had grudgingly advanced from the taxes
a sum which he warned them was inadequate.
Nevertheless he had set to work, and the results
were now before me. The swamp was still
swamp, the embankment not completed, of the
drains not more than a sixth were dug, and the
whole was a confusion of mud-heaps, apparent
ruin and chaos, very unattractive to the eye and
very unpromising, in its outward aspect at least,
of any result. It had all the character of waste
and folly—yet a sum of money, small in comparison
with many private resources and insignificant
in the budget of the town, would suffice to crown
the whole and to replace the wretched prospect
of unfinished labour by a noble plain of rich
gardens and new houses. But the headmen of the
city were now disgusted and would vote no more.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
Rather did they threaten him with penalties for
his loss of public pence.</p>

<p>“I had, during this torrent of talk, interjected
here and there a question and no more. I had
spoken guardedly and yet with no disrespect for
his enthusiasm. I had, as we say among the
merchants, ‘sounded him.’ I asked him in conclusion
what sum he thought necessary for the
completion of his enterprise. He named 300 gold
pieces, about one-quarter of what lay concealed
in my sacks upon the ground, which sacks (I had
casually informed him) were filled with coarse
grain from the hills.</p>

<p>“Upon hearing this sum given, a sum so well
within my means, an interior light broke upon me.
I did not pray for guidance, as is my custom in
any business dealing of doubt. I was directly
and immediately inspired. To this I owe the
whole of my present position; for it was the
foundation of all that followed. I had suffered
vicissitude. It is the lot of man. But henceforward
my soul was to be filled with increasing
and ever-increasing wealth until I should be able
to call myself, as I do now, by far the richest man
in all the Caliphate and perhaps in the world.
This, my dear nephews, was the turning-point!”</p>

<p>The old man’s eyes were full of tears, his
voice trembled; never had the awestruck boys
imagined that their uncle, in his greatness and
serenity, could be so moved.</p>

<p>“Oh, my children!” he continued in broken
accents, “never forget in your own lives this
master precept; that of all those whom Allah
presents to us for exploitation, none, none is so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
lucrative as the Creative Enthusiast; the man
who can make and produce and yet be managed!
the Genius devoid of Guile! You may know him,
that rare jewel, by his eyes.”</p>

<p>The old man recovered himself with dignity,
wiped his eyes on a piece of priceless embroidered
silk from Samarcand, threw it out of the window,
and, in his more usual tone, pursued the recital
of his fortunes.</p>

<p>“The young man never dreamt that such a
chance and dusty traveller as I, with my one mule,
could help him. He had merely burst out with
his story to me as he would have done to any
human being that would hear him. I had the more
advantage of him from his ignorance of my real
wealth.</p>

<p>“I told him soberly at the end of his tale that
it interested me greatly, that his idea was evidently
sound, but that the stupidity, ignorance,
and suspicion of town councillors were common
not only to his city, but to all others—a thing
which I, who had travelled widely, could judge.
I assured him, out of a vast experience (which
he accepted with the utmost simplicity), that he
could hope for no more from such a source. I
then fell into a sort of bemused condition, as
though I were ruminating what could next be
done.</p>

<p>“The young man, his hopes now turned into a
new channel, and, after so brief an acquaintance
(for such is the nature of these enthusiasts)
already beginning to look to me for aid, watched
my face most anxiously. I continued silent.</p>

<p>“At last he could bear it no longer. He asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
me impetuously what I should advise—where
could he turn? What could be done? It would
be a tragedy—a murder—for his great scheme
to fail merely because its obvious advantage could
not be put before anyone who had the provision
of 300 gold pieces necessary for paying the
labourers till the plan was achieved. He sprang
to his feet. He walked feverishly up and down.
He betrayed all the symptoms of his case.</p>

<p>“I answered him with great deliberation and
firmness. I said, first of all, that I had nothing.
It was a pity, for I thoroughly understood his
idea. I admired it. I believed in it. Indeed, it
was obviously sound. If I had had the wherewithal
(said I) I would at once have made the
advance. If I had had even a portion I would have
put that portion at his disposal if only to show
my sincere appreciation of his genius. For it
was the neglect of men like himself (I continued)
that hindered the progress of the world. But so it
was! I had but my trade as an itinerant merchant
in grain to support myself and a very large
family which I had left at home in the hills. I
had nothing laid by.... However, my annual
tour through this and neighbouring provinces
brought me into contact (these were my very
words) with many notables possessed of ample
reserves. In this very town—now that he had
told me its name—I remembered two or three
correspondents with whom I had done business
in the past, though I had never seen them. These
I would approach. And if he would give me an
appointment that evening after sunset I would
tell him if I had been able to effect anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>“He overwhelmed me with thanks, led me to
an excellent house of call in the town, and, leaving
me there with an appointed hour for our meeting
in the evening, he returned to his labours with
a lighter heart.</p>

<p>“I, for my part, retired to an inner room which
I had hired, there disposed of my baggage (having
seen to the stabling and feeding of my honest
mule), and instantly fell upon my knees to thank
Allah with all the fervour I could muster for His
abounding grace. Indeed, my heart overflowed
with gratitude when I considered the quite exceptional
opportunity. I felt about this young man
as does a caravan, when, after a weary march
through the desert, there gleams a pure lake not
half an hour away. How short a space of time
now lay between this moment and the beginnings
of splendid negotiations!</p>

<p>“Having so prayed with the deepest sincerity
and humility, I first took out exactly <i>two</i> hundred
pieces of gold from my sacks, tied them into a
kerchief about my person, and then lay down
upon a mat to sleep, first warning the servants
of the place to wake me when the young man
should return. I slept soundly for many hours.</p>

<p>“When they woke me it was already dark. I
rose at once, lit the lamp, and received my young
friend into the room. All was silent. We were
alone under the one light of that subdued flame.
The hour was propitious for what I had undertaken.</p>

<p>“I told him that I had spent the interval, since
he left me, in seeking my wealthy correspondents
and in making myself acquainted with their views<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
upon the town’s circumstances and upon the
opportunities for investment. I said that I had
briefly and very cautiously mentioned the works
I saw going on in the swamp as I had approached
their city, and that I had discovered at once, by
their pitying contempt for his enterprise, that
there was no chance at all of interesting them in
its progress. They called it—as did all their
fellow-citizens—a folly. They bitterly regretted
the public money that had already been advanced.
They would certainly advance no more. They
talked freely of bringing him to trial for wasting
the public revenue. As for any private investment
of their own fortunes, I clearly saw that it
was out of the question.</p>

<p>“Here I paused to let this information sink in,
and was pleased to observe the growing dejection
of his features. But before he could voice
his despair—though he had expected as much—I
relieved him by another strain. I told him I had
raised a certain sum. Partly upon the security
of my known stores of grain (of which I was
carrying samples—pointing to the bags on the
floor that contained my money), partly on my own
personal security as an honest merchant, poor but
of regular and punctual habit in payment, I had
secured a loan which I had told them was for the
general purpose of increasing my business, but
which in point of fact I intended to put at his
disposal—such confidence had I in his scheme. I
feared it would be insufficient, but it would be a
beginning—later we might find further means.</p>

<p>“His honest, eager face changed as I spoke.
It was delightful to feel that I could give so much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
joy, however brief, to so candid a soul. He had,
however, a certain scruple. He said it was not
his business, but he would rather there had been
no ambiguity, and the money advanced for a purpose
known to the lenders.</p>

<p>“I praised the nobility of such hesitation, but
I pointed out that the risk was mine: that I had
only spoken of ‘a general purpose of increasing
my business,’ no false phrase; that I was so certain
of <i>our</i> success that the loan was at any rate
secure. In any case, business (of which he had
little acquaintance) was always conducted on such
lines (I assured him) and my backers being also
business men would be the last to split hairs on
points of honour when I paid back their loan.
This soothed him and he was now quite prepared
for what followed.</p>

<p>“I asked him again what sum he required? He
told me he employed a hundred labourers, that
their wages came to twenty gold pieces a week,
and that he estimated fifteen weeks as the very
least period in which the whole ground could be
cleared and dried and set out. In all, he repeated,
<i>three</i> hundred pieces of gold would be required:
as he had said. I noted to myself privately once
more that it was one-quarter of my hoard, and
then, when he had completed his calculation, I
thus addressed him:</p>

<p>“‘It is as I feared! The sum I have obtained
is hardly sufficient. I have raised but <i>two</i> hundred
pieces of gold!’ His face fell again. ‘But
that will take us pretty far,’ I went on. ‘We may
with care <i>nearly</i> complete our work, and the
rest of it should be easy to find.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>“It has always surprised me how exact such
men are in judgment and yet how little they use
their talent to their own advantage. He was
anxious. He was certain that beginning on too
small a sum was dangerous. But I persuaded
him; for no more (said I) could possibly be
obtained.</p>

<p>“What made all smooth was my proposal for
Articles between us. These generously proposed
that, though I had found the money, yet of the
resultant profit we should take equal shares. ‘I
propose that your own salary during the work,’
said I, ‘should be small; indeed, no more than
your bare maintenance. For we have no margin,
nay, less than we need. But if you are not agreeable,
pray name your terms.’ He could find no
words for my generosity! Of course he would
live on the least possible sum and work to an
extreme! He had no right (said he) to claim
a half! It was achievement, not fortune, that he
desired.</p>

<p>“I insisted. He gratefully yielded. We drew
up the document in duplicate. He was especially
gratified to find that I had left the whole direction
to him. ‘I know nothing of such things,’ I said.
‘I am only the Business Man. You are the
Creator, the Artist: I am but the base mercantile
instrument, and I shall be proud to share in your
triumph.’ As I said this I put into my eyes the
expression of inspired admiration which we of the
commercial world very properly assume when we
are dealing with this kind of fodder.</p>

<p>“The next morning, in the cool, before the sun
had power, our deeds were attested. I warned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
him to be utterly silent upon the source of this
capital. I said I would be responsible for a
rumour that a small saving of his own was
engaged. He saw my point, and, though still
scrupulous, consented. The work went forward.</p>

<p>“My next step I had already planned. I had
privately set aside for it a fixed sum, the equal
of what I had given my partner. I hired a pleasant
little house and garden in the city, with a fountain
of clear water in its shaded court. I
purchased a stock of good clothes and even one or
two not over-violent jewels—and I began to entertain.</p>

<p>“I bought—at a price which gave me pause—a
really wonderful cook; I learnt the games of
hazard to which the wealthier of the place were
devoted. The headmen of the various quarters
of the city, the principal councillors and magistrates
learned one from another of the excellence
of my table and the interest of my play. I became
their intimate. From time to time I spoke
of my friendship with the Enthusiast and of my
regret at his wasting his poor savings upon the
dreadful mess outside the walls. They agreed—and
all the while that fervid young man redoubled
his ardour, himself worked side by side with his
men, planned, urged them on, and effected prodigies
of labour. Indeed, I feared for his health—a
natural anxiety for one in my situation—but by
the Mercy of Allah it remained perfect.</p>

<p>“He now, however, came to me more and more
frequently and in a greater and greater anxiety.
There were but fifty gold pieces remaining, but
forty, but twenty!... It was a matter of a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
days!... Already he had had to keep back
wages, to devise half-shifts, even to discharge
men!... Could I not, oh! could I not raise some
further sum?... As he had said, the work
needed another month at least, and its present
state was appalling, no visible security for a
loan, all mud and confusion!... I could only
reply that I would do my best, but that I was
not sanguine, and my long face increased his
fears.</p>

<p>“Perturbed as he was he had the generosity
to regret <i>my</i> loss in the unfortunate enterprise.</p>

<p>“I showed a strong indifference and told him
that I was used to the rubs of this sad world
and that my trust was in Allah!</p>

<p>“At last, as the day when his funds would be
exhausted was at hand, I gave a feast of special
importance to the treasurer and the chief magistrates
of the city, and there led the talk on to the
works still continuing. I heard the usual grumble
that the sum originally advanced out of the
taxes was sunk in a morass, that the young man
had, apparently, funds of his own for continuing
the nonsense and that yet the city could recover
nothing from him. I approved a threat that, out
of sheer annoyance, they might stop the whole
thing and put him in gaol till he should pay, or
at any rate suffer for, his unsettled debt to his
fellow-townsmen.</p>

<p>“Then it was that I struck, for the hour was
ripe! I pleaded for him as a friend. I let them
feel my influence, I waited for the suggestion—and
I was not disappointed. The treasurer after
a little solemn hesitation said to me: ‘Sir, since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
you know this young fellow and seem to be in
his councils, can you not discover what remains
to him and perhaps make him reimburse the gold
pieces he owes to our town-fund? We should be
beholden to you.’ I answered that my intimacy
with the Enthusiast hardly went so far, but that
I would do my best. Only I begged them for the
interval of a week.</p>

<p>“The day after the morrow of that feast the
Young Man came to me in an excessive perturbation.
The mud of his travail was still on his
hands, and I was concerned to see him limping
from the effect (as he told me) of a heavy barrow
which had overset as he wheeled it and crushed
his big toe. But he neglected the pain in his
extreme mental distress and told me that, having
paid that week’s wages, his gold pieces were now
reduced to <i>ten</i>. Even if he himself ate but dry
bread in the next few days and sold his poor
belongings he could not meet the next account,
which was but seven days distant.</p>

<p>“I cast my eyes on the ground and delayed a
while, the more to impress him. I then told him
in grave and subdued tones that I had very bad
news. I glanced up a moment to note the wildness
in his eyes upon this blow, then cast them
down at the ground and continued: ‘I have private
advice—perhaps I should not have divulged
it to you, for it was given in confidence, but my
concern and affection for you have proved too
strong—I have private advice that the council
intend this very week to demand most formally
the repayment of 100 pieces of gold which they
say is due from you for advances long ago made,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
and failing payment to cast you into their
dungeon.’</p>

<p>“The Young Man leapt suddenly to his feet,
gave a loud shriek, and made to beat his head
against the wall. It was with difficulty that I
held his hands and restrained him.</p>

<p>“‘Oh! Curse my birth!’ he cried in a paroxysm
of despair. ‘And curse my generation!
My day has come!’ He raved. He incoherently
demanded miracles and alternately denied the
Justice of Allah! Grown more subdued but still
distraught, he moaned of his affections. He told
me—what I had hitherto not known and what
interested me very little—that he had a little
sister, orphaned as he was, who, if he were put
away, would starve or become the prey of
strangers. ‘What could be done? What refuge
discovered? Curse the day when his fatal dream
had struck him! Curse his works! Curse the
river! Curse the marsh! Curse the city!’</p>

<p>“And so on—the usual reaction of enthusiasts.
It was most distressing. I still held his writhing
hands firmly till he was calm enough to hear me,
and then said:</p>

<p>“‘Listen to me. I have considered your case.
I think I can rescue you. I have myself saved a
little from my trading operations of the last two
months in this town. My credit also is somewhat
extended. <i>I</i> will find what you need. For
I respect genius and I do not judge by common
standards——’</p>

<p>“I was proceeding when he burst out into
extravagant gratitude; called me his benefactor,
kissed my hand again and again, and irrelevantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
alluded again to that little sister of his who
really had nothing to do with the case. I checked
him and continued:</p>

<p>“‘I will do more. You do not know your own
value—I mean your own moral and intellectual
worth—nor what admiration they excite in men
who judge as I do that the rest is dross. Our
enterprise is clearly lost’—he nodded his agreement.
‘My investment you may say is gone: or,
at any rate, I must take it for what it is worth as
a thing half-derelict and gravely threatened by
the authorities. But <i>you</i> shall not go under.
<i>Your</i> high talents shall not be wasted so long
as I have credit for commerce.... Come. Our
original agreement is useless now. It is waste
paper. Well, we’ll tear it up.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, sir!’ said he. ‘And what of <i>you</i>? All
this trust in me and my work, all this fund of
money laid out by you! All this kindness and
support without which I——’</p>

<p>“‘Say no more,’ I interrupted, ‘my mind is
made up. I have here a draft of my intention,
which I hope will jump with yours.’ So saying
I pulled out duplicate papers on which were written
very simple terms. The original (and now
worthless) agreement for an imaginary and unobtainable
profit was cancelled. I promised in
the new draft to take over the wretched unfinished
works (they were worth nothing), to indemnify
the poor fellow against any public claims, and to
guarantee him an ample salary for one year from
the date of signing. I now added more. I bound
myself, in the event of his death or prolonged
imprisonment within this year, to pay to his heirs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the sum of 100 pieces of gold. This, I pointed out
to him, would provide for his little sister (of
whom I had now heard enough), while to myself
I excused the extravagance by considering his
really robust health and the power of my protection
to save him from incarceration.</p>

<p>“I would not have believed that a human being
could feel so strongly. He fell at my feet, calling
me his providence, his all, his bulwark and refuge.
He said he did not know there was such goodness
among men. I bade him not exaggerate. I reminded
him how noble minds had in all ages
loved to support the Arts, and cited Yussouf-abd-Arham,
Sulim-ben-Achab, Muswuf, Wawoo, Mah
and other worthies. At last our business was completed,
the new deeds signed and attested by my
servants, and the gallant fellow, for whose
ingenuous character I still retain a profound
respect, was put to sleep in happy exhaustion
upon soft carpets in my guest-room. I there left
him to dream of his little sister and his mud-heaps,
while I betook myself to a short casting-up of
accounts followed by nightly prayers to the All-Merciful
who guides His servant into pleasant
places.</p>

<p>“Next morning I sent the Enthusiast back to
his labours (with a little cash to carry on with)
and very carefully thought out my plans.</p>

<p>“First, at the next dinner I gave, I told my
guests (who were, as usual, among the chief men
of the city) that I proposed a deal in corn with
the factors of Tambulistan: the place did not,
as a fact, exist, but the name was well chosen and
attractive. They were distant (I said) but in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
correspondence with me; and as they had a glut
and I had news of a dearth in my own country
I had taken the opportunity of a deal through
third parties. I saw a profit of some 100 pieces
of gold. Not more (said I). I was a modest man
and only did business in a small way. My guests
gallantly denied this and smiled in polite interest,
but no more, till, a little later in the meal, I said
that the transaction had been just a little heavy
for me and that I had looked round for some one
who would help in settlement and would share
the profit. I told them this profit was fairly certain,
that no ready cash was required more than
I had myself provided, but that, as a bill or two
would do no harm, I had obtained one from a
friend at home. All this in the way of general
talk.</p>

<p>“As might be expected, the Chief Magistrate of
the town (my most honoured guest) approached
me after dinner and told me privately that he
would be happy to oblige. I told him there was no
sort of necessity, I could draw what I would on
my letters from home, or at any rate enough to
meet the case. That if he <i>really</i> cared to share
my little adventure I expected about ten per cent.
profit on the sum engaged—but indeed it was too
small for me to trouble him with it. I accepted
his pledge of 100 pieces of gold—but I stoutly
refused any paper, ‘Your name is enough,’ I
said, ‘I shall gratefully use it. My people will
trust my word.’</p>

<p>“I gave out next morning that I was going
into the hills to meet a messenger. I did indeed
pass through the city gate and proceeded till I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
was well out of sight; but as there was no sense
in fatiguing myself I slept through the heat in
a wood, watched through the warm night, and
returned travel-stained in the evening of the second
day.</p>

<p>“On the morning of the third day I met the
Chief Magistrate in the Bazaar: I stopped him,
chatted, and then and there paid him eleven pieces
of gold. ‘I met my messenger from Tambulistan’
(said I) ‘we exchanged parcels, and I find I have
netted just over the ten per cent. These eleven
pieces are your proportion upon your kind investment
of 100.’ He protested of course that it had
been no investment, merely a few friendly words
of support; but he took the money, and I could
see that he was pleased. He was curiously
pleased. Indeed, he was so pleased that, though
a discreet man, he could not forbear mentioning
the matter to his wife. Rich men love small
windfalls.</p>

<p>“In a few hours, therefore, the Head Mufti,
the Chief of the Guard, and two very important
councillors had in their various ways touched
casually upon the wheat trade during short conversations
in which each had separately engaged
me under the shades of the Bazaar. A little later,
as I took the air by the riverside at evening, the
principal Ascetic of the district, who had come in
to buy his few lentils for the week, spoke to me
briefly of the same matter. I gave each of them
a different answer, alluding to various cargoes of
wheat, caravans of wheat and tumbrils of wheat—all
in technical terms; to risks, to covering sums,
to transfers from one district to another. In each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
case I refused anything but a pledge to stand in
with a transaction somewhat beyond my unaided
powers; in each case I ridiculed the smallness
of the little adventure; in each case I paid, after
the lapse of a few days, to one a single piece of
gold as his profit, to another two, to another
three. And each was very pleased.</p>

<p>“As the days went by I varied the procedure.
Sometimes I regretted the unexpectedly small
profit obtained. Once I deliberately announced a
loss and sternly gathered reluctant contributions
from my associates; but immediately afterwards
I did another fine stroke in imaginary wheat and
paid a fat dividend to my friends—indeed, that
particular affair cost me twenty-five pieces. But
it was worth it. I got rid in less than a month of
200 pieces of gold in this fashion. It was a cruel
trial, but proved, in the event, most fruitful. For
though I would never advise in large investments,
yet by this simple method, my reputation for judgment
in that which men most value—which is
money—was assured.</p>

<p>“I had set 250 pieces aside for this experiment,
and my total stock was running low when I steered
my ship to port.</p>

<p>“First, out of my remainder, I brought to the
city council fifty pieces of gold saying that I had
with difficulty screwed them from my young
friend, who was still digging away in the outskirts,
but that he had faithfully promised the second
fifty in two months’ time. Next I created a sort
of stupor in the now large circle of my friends by
saying publicly and boldly that I was beginning
to see something in this plan of draining the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
marsh. I reminded them that the Engineer had
always been my friend, that I had always seen
something in him, that in spite of his obvious lack
of business sense I could not help admiring his
talent in his own line.</p>

<p>“The place was by this time dried and levelled,
the embankment was all fairly sloped and paved,
the cuttings, heaps, and rubbish had disappeared.
Then it was that I took a party of these my important
friends out to view the place at evening from
the city walls and quietly told them that it was
mine.</p>

<p>“There it lay before them: a magnificent plain,
reclaimed and ordered, firm land pegged out in
rows and with neat placards of new streets, all
named.</p>

<p>“You know, my dear nephews, the admiration
excited in all men of affairs for one who has forestalled
them. I rose in the estimation of my neighbours
to a height beyond compare. They already
had a most deep reverence for my keen perceptions
in commerce which had been proved in so
many little tips—insignificant in quantity, but, oh!
so universally accurate. Now, indeed, upon learning
this great stroke (or, as they called it in the
local language, ‘Koo’) they were lost in surprise
and respect.</p>

<p>“After sunset I counted my money. I had left
precisely fifty pieces of gold: a close aim, a narrow
edge of venture. But, as the proverb says,
‘The bold hunter slays the lion, the timid is slain
of the cub.’</p>

<p>“It was late in that same night that the Chief
Magistrate knocked at my door with the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
precaution, bearing a hooded lantern, and walking
on tiptoe. He begged me as an old friend (but in
a whisper) to sell him so much land in the new
quarter as might suffice for a good house and garden,
suitable for his son or even for himself. I
told him that I would have no sordid dealings
with so excellent a friend. I could not do less than
<i>give</i> him such a site.</p>

<p>“I brought out a plan (on which the Engineer
had already drawn out streets and public squares)
and marked upon the main thoroughfare the plot
I would assign to him. He departed with praise
and blessings. Hardly had he gone when a yet
more furtive step approached my door. It was the
Mufti. He offered me a hundred pieces of gold
for such a site. I generously gave him for <i>fifty</i>
a larger one than he had ventured to beg. I
marked it somewhat farther down the same main
thoroughfare. He went away belauding my name
and soul.</p>

<p>“It was near midnight when another footfall
halted at my door: a councillor’s. For fifty pieces
he also had a site worth double, and in the same
street. He had not gone an hour, it was the darkest
of the night, when a much fainter shuffling of
bare feet could be just perceived followed by a
light trying of the latch. The door was opened a
crack and the strong emaciated face of the Ascetic
twisted round the edge and peered in. I beckoned
him. He put his finger to his lips, cautiously
secured the fastening of the lock—and then, bending
forward, whispered in my ear.... I was a
little surprised at the magnitude of his offer, but
of course I accepted it at once. Such men have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
great influence with the faithful. He proposed to
<i>let</i> his property or perhaps to hold for a rise. He
would continue of course to live in his humble cell
outside the city, in the wastes. He departed
quickly and like a ghost. At dawn came yet another
councillor, more bold than the rest, who
made a plain business proposition for block fifty-three
and was at once gratified.</p>

<p>“So for days the procession continued, each
man coming singly and watching whether he were
observed. Half the council had sites for little or
nothing, and the other half had sites at rates
really very reasonable.</p>

<p>“And all the while, to the mass of buyers who
importuned me and clamoured about me, I said
that only very limited sales could be made, and
those of leases only, and even so not till a later
date.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the whole town council was converted.
The councillors had quite lost their old
aversion to the scheme. They earmarked enthusiastically
and by a unanimous vote a special tax
for the laying out of the new quarter, its planting
with trees, the bringing of conduits to it so that
fountains of sweet water might appear in private
houses and in public places, and, though the levy
was no light one, it was paid cheerfully enough by
all the councillors, who were now curiously proud
of their town’s aggrandizement; even among the
mass of poor ratepayers there were no executions,
but only one mild case of torture, and perhaps a
dozen bastinadoes.</p>

<p>“The public money so spent was very well
worth while. The improvement in my property<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
was immense; and when a fine road, bordered with
trees, was laid down all along the embankment I
obtained very heavy compensation from the city
for the use of the ground and the cutting off of my
approaches to the river.</p>

<p>“I, on my side, was not niggardly. I promised
100 gold pieces to the building of a new mosque in
the centre of the place, on condition that ninety-nine
others should do the same, and I started a
hall of public recreation, the price of admission to
which barely repaid the expenses of upkeep and
cleaning, taxes, heat and light, interest on debentures
(which I had myself very handsomely subscribed),
service, literature, and secretarial expenses,
decoration, approaches, annual depreciation,
and at the most a profit of six to eight per
cent. I also provided kitchens where the poorer
citizens could purchase food at very little more
than its value. These were of great service to the
police, who had here a central place whence the
movements of my less fortunate neighbours could
be traced. I presented also public fountains with
solid pewter mugs, attached to the stonework by
strong chains lest they should be stolen, and I
even went so far as to provide, free of all cost,
public plans of the new quarter showing where
unleased sites still remained and the terms on
which they might be acquired.</p>

<p>“I made it a rule that any man building a house
on my land should promise to give it up to me for
nothing after twenty years; but as many people
were too poor to build their own houses I established
a fund whence they could borrow the money
at the ordinary rates of interest and the few dues,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
fees, deductions, etc., inevitable to such transactions.
In every way did I develop and benefit
this my creation of a new town.</p>

<p>“I had my reward in the profound respect and
honour paid me by my fellow-citizens. These
were convened by the Council at an appropriate
date to decide what recognition should be made
of my services. They finally agreed, after long
discussion and many very eloquent discourses,
upon an illuminated parchment, which was presented
to me with the most flattering cheers and
songs upon the public square of the new quarter,
in a tent of purple silk specially voted for the
occasion and later claimed as a perquisite by my
butler.</p>

<p>“I replied in a suitable manner to the acclamations
of the crowd and the kindly flattery of the
councillors; but I told them, at the end of my
address, that I should feel ungrateful indeed if,
upon such an occasion, a certain humble fellow-worker
of mine were overlooked in the public rejoicings.
Thereupon I extended my hand to the
Enthusiast, that young Engineer of Parts whom
I had so fortunately met some months before and
whom I had arranged should be near the steps of
my dais at the required moment. I handed him
up. I smiled benignantly upon him as he blushed
with happy shame and pleasure. I even set him
at my side.</p>

<p>“‘It is all very well, my friends,’ said I, as I
concluded my little speech, ‘to speak as you do of
the foresight and business acumen, organizing
power, and the rest of it, which—I hope justly—you
ascribe to me when you tell me how, as with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
a magic wand, I raised all this new city from the
marsh which preceded it. But what would such
gifts be had they not been aided and supplemented
by talents no less essential, such as those which
we all admire in this young friend at my right?
He it is who has performed, sometimes in a very
literal sense, the spade-work. His has been the
hard, obscure, constant labour and vigilance, without
which my own more conspicuous efforts would
have been in vain!’</p>

<p>“After a few subdued cheers from the assembly,
most of whom had never heard of the young
man, while the rest had forgotten him, all dispersed,
and I was free to seek repose in my own
new and sumptuous house.</p>

<p>“I am glad to say that this public mention of
my worthy young colleague was not all I did for
him. As the agreed salary which I paid him by
our contract would now soon expire, I arranged
with the Council that he should have a permanent
post as keeper of the public squares, at a wage
more than double that of the gardeners, and be
granted (on condition of good behaviour) a limited
pension when he should reach his seventieth
year, the same to be deducted in small weekly
sums from his pay: which sums, as he was not
yet thirty-two would accumulate to much more
than was necessary and leave over and above his
retiring stipend a balance for anything the Council
might think useful. He was also lent, rent
free, a small four-roomed house with a nice strip
of front garden and a wooden shed at the side.
His duties occupied him from a little before sunrise
to the pleasant dusk of eve, with an hour off
for meals and a fortnight’s holiday in the autumn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>“Even his little sister was not forgotten. I
obtained for her, from my friends among the
religious authorities (notably the Mufti, who was
most strenuous in her cause) the post of head
cleaner at the new mosque. Her salary there was
necessarily somewhat smaller than her brother’s,
nor had she any holidays, while her hours were a
trifle longer. But, on the other hand, she had no
responsibilities.</p>

<p>“Shortly after all this I determined to sell my
holding in this new property and to betake myself
to other mercantile adventures in further lands.
I had been in this place more than a year. I had
made very good friends. It was the scene of a
success greater than any I had yet experienced.
Nevertheless I felt I could remain there no longer.
The field was too small for my expanding opportunities.
There was nothing left to take.</p>

<p>“I announced, therefore, my intentions to realize,
and allowed a certain interval for a public
decision upon the purchase of my land, and leases,
and other interests.</p>

<p>“A curious discussion arose. One party, composed
mainly of wealthy but intelligent young
men, of university professors and of jail-birds,
were insistent that the Town Council should buy
all my land and the city possess it for the future;
for it was obviously wrong (they agreed) that
improvements in land and houses should go to
private individuals. The other party, which was
made up almost entirely of builders and auctioneers,
furiously opposed this scheme which (they
said) struck at the roots of all morals and family
life. <i>These</i> stoutly maintained that, in the natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
scheme of Providence, all should be parcelled out
among the highest bidders.</p>

<p>“For my part I was, like the great mass of the
taxpayers, indifferent to either argument. All
that interested me was the obvious fact that in the
competition between these two groups on the
Council the value of my property necessarily rose.</p>

<p>“At last the first party prevailed, the city
bought me out (really a most interesting social
experiment!), and I received the sum of two million
pieces of gold.”</p>

<p>“Two million pieces!” shouted the astonished
little nephews in chorus.</p>

<p>“My children,” said the old man with a kindly
smile, “to you, coming as you do from such a
home as that of your father, my dear brother, the
sum must seem fabulous, though to me to-day it
sounds moderate enough. Nevertheless, you are
right. From that moment I count the great change
in my life and the confirmation of that Divine
Mercy which had always watched me hitherto, as
I now know, but which henceforward was gloriously
present in every act of my life.</p>

<p>“Before the day when I first saw that river and
that town, first met the enthusiastic young Engineer,
first formed my decisive plan, I had been a
man subject to grave anxieties and sufferings;
now precariously affluent, now starving; now
again doubtfully possessed of some fleeting money.
Then came the marvellous year I have just recited.
Since then I have enjoyed the results of so
much persistence and skill. I have gathered and
enjoyed without cease the fruits of great and
increasing wealth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, uncle, what are these?”</p>

<p>“They are,” said the good old merchant in
grave and reverent tones, “the honour of neighbours,
the devotion of friends, the admiration of
all mankind, a permanent self-respect, and—what
is more important than them all—the Strong
Peace of the Soul.”</p>

<p>The intolerable howl of the Muezzin checked his
nephews’ reply, and they, their happy eyes shining
as though they themselves were the recipients
of these seven figures went home in a dream
of gold.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
  <small>ENTITLED <i>AL-FULÚS AL-MASNÚ MIN AL-QIRTÁS</i>,<br />
  OR THE MONEY MADE OF PAPER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">On</span>
the appointed day of the next week the little
boys were glad to observe that the number
of public executions had fallen so far below the
average that their uncle’s entertainment of them
could begin quite half an hour before the usual
time. They were most eager to discover what further
good fortune had befallen him by the Mercy
of Allah.</p>

<p>The amiable old man opened his mouth and
spoke:</p>

<p>“Two million gold pieces is a respectable sum
of money. It weighs about thirty tons ... yes,”
he calculated rapidly on his bejewelled fingers,
“about thirty tons. The city could just produce
it after scouring the country for miles around,
searching all the more modest houses and melting
down sundry antique lamps, wedding rings, sacred
shrines and other gewgaws.</p>

<p>“The complete withdrawal of so much metal
left them a little embarrassed for coin in everyday
affairs, but really that was not my business.
I packed a hundred strong iron chests with the
bullion, reserving a few thousands in a leather
bag, set them in carts, added to my retinue a hundred
armed men, marked my cases plainly in large
white letters ‘<span class="smcap">Sand consigned to the Sultan</span>,’
and had all made ready to set out: but whither?</p>

<p>“Until a man’s wealth has grown so great that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
he can command the whole state, he is always in
some peril. He is envied and a target for vile
taxes—nay for confiscation.... I had not forgotten
the dreadful lesson of the island! I pondered
on what I had read of various regions, and
had rejected each in turn as dangerous, when I
heard by chance a man saying to his neighbour
(with whom he was quarrelling), ‘Remember!
This is not the country of Dirak where there is
one law for the rich and another for the poor.’
As you may well believe I deeply considered these
random words, and within an hour I was giving
an excellent meal to a Learned Man who taught
in the University, famous for his knowledge of
foreign constitutions. I spoke of the Franks, of
the Maghreb, of Rome. On all he was most interesting
and full: he spoke also with contempt of
certain wild tribes in the hills who have a strange
custom of choosing a retired Chief annually from
among the less wealthy members, under the barbarous
error that modest means conduce to honesty
and sharpen judgment.</p>

<p>“‘As in Dirak,’ said I casually.</p>

<p>“‘In Dirak?’ he exclaimed astonished. ‘Why!
Who can have told you such tales? Dirak is the
best administered, the most flourishing and the
strongest of all states!’</p>

<p>“‘No doubt,’ I answered, ‘but what has that to
do with it?’</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ said he, in sudden anger (for this kind
of learned man is commonly half-mad) ‘it has
everything to do with it! Such advantages can only
come from the secure rule of the rich....
A fool could see that!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>“I soothed him by immediate agreement, professed
my admiration at his vast store of knowledge
and pumped him all that afternoon on Dirak.</p>

<p>“It seemed that in this admirable region the
Rich rule unquestioned to the immense profit of
the State. The Sultan is kept on a strict allowance
that he may be the puppet of the great merchants,
bankers and landholders who are the masters
of the Commonwealth and him. The middle
classes are allowed a livelihood but no possessions,
and are proud of their small incomes, which usually
put them above the artizans; while the populace
are content to swarm in hovels underground,
to work hard all day and all the year round for
a little food and to revere and acclaim the rich
with frenzied cheers upon all public occasions.
Laws and proclamations are purchased, and their
administration is in the hands of the rich, of whom
a select few sit upon the bench and condemn a
fixed number of the populace, and a few of the
middle classes, to imprisonment every year by
way of discipline and example. No man possessing
more than a hundred thousand gold pieces
worth of land or stock can be punished, and if a
poor man tell any unpleasing thing of such a one
he is beaten till he admits his falsehood or, if he
prove obstinate, slowly starved to death.</p>

<p>“It is a model State. All is in perfect order.
The palaces of the rulers are the most magnificent
in the world: all public office is faithfully and
punctually performed. It is the envy of every
neighbour, the pride and delight of every citizen
however mean; for—what is the basis of the whole
affair—every man in Dirak is esteemed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
extent of his possessions alone; writing and music
and work in metals and painted tiles are esteemed
for the pretty things they are: holiness is revered
indeed, but confined to the well-to-do; and a man’s
virtue, judgment and wit are rightly gauged by
his property.</p>

<p>“My many adventures had somewhat blunted
me to new sensations. But I confess (my dear
nephews) that as I heard this tale an ecstasy filled
my soul. I masked my emotions and simply said,
‘An interesting place!’</p>

<p>“‘It is reached by a plain road from here,’ volunteered
the Learned Man, ‘though at the expense
of a long journey: for it takes a caravan quite a
month to reach the capital of Dirak from this
place. You go up the river to its source in the
hills, a week’s travel to the east; then the well-marked
road leads you over a pass to a most singular
cup or natural cauldron, with a flat, highly
cultivated floor, formerly the bed of a lake and
surrounded on all sides by precipitous limestone
cliffs, down which the road descends by artificial
cuttings in their surface. This strangely isolated
spot, famous for its gardens and simple happiness,
is called with its chief village Skandir, and
strangers are there most hospitably entertained.</p>

<p>“‘The only issue thence, on the far side, is by
a narrow gorge leading through the mountains,
beyond which again are vast plains of grassy
lands, the grazing place of nomads: well watered
and provisioned at reasonable distances by simple
but well furnished villages. The great road goes
through all these, still eastward.</p>

<p>“‘These prairies get drier and drier as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
rise eastward until, for the last day of your progress,
at the
<span class="replace" id="tn_5" title="Probably the same location as the wells of Ayn-Ayoub">wells of Ayn-ayoum</span>
you must take a
supply of water, for the next twenty-four hours
are desert. You reach a crest of the slow ascent
and see below you from the summit of the road
some half a day’s going across the plain below,
the magnificent capital of Dirak.</p>

<p>“‘This noble city, whose name is Mawazan, was
founded by the enormously wealthy——’</p>

<p>“‘Yes! Yes!’ I interrupted in a bored tone—for
I knew all I wanted to know, ‘some day I
must go there. A very amusing journey no doubt.
But meanwhile business is business and I must
start very early for the north to-morrow morning
to look after some purchases I have made in
grains; and I must not waste any more of your
time.’</p>

<p>“The learned are slow to take a hint, so I locked
my arm in his after a friendly fashion and led him
genially to the door, where he tried (unsuccessfully)
to detain me for further remarks on yet
another country famous for its enormous bats.</p>

<p>“When I had got well rid of him—it was already
dark—I beat up my quarters without delay,
aligned my caravan, added to the inscription on
my iron treasure chests the words ‘of Dirak’ (so
that the labels now ran ‘<span class="smcap">Sand for the Sultan of
Dirak</span>’), marshalled my armed troop and set out in
the night by the northern road. But, long before
daybreak, I ordered a deflection to the right,
struck the great road along the river and so proceeded
eastward into the hills.</p>

<p>“It was as the Learned Man had said: a week’s
marching to the sources of the stream led to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
pass, and we saw below us at evening a splendid
spectacle: that small oval plain of Skandir all
girded with enormous precipices, a garden of fruit
trees and grain with great prosperous villages in
its midst, and the road picking its way by cuttings
in the living rock down to the valley floor, and
thence making straight for the main town.</p>

<p>“We reached it under a new moon in the second
hour of darkness. Its hospitality had not been
exaggerated. The good peasants received us with
every kindness and I was lodged in a most comfortable
house, my chests and grain in the courtyard
and my numerous retinue under lesser roofs
around.</p>

<p>“Next day—as luck would have it—a wretched
accident befell me! I was taking the air at the
door of my house, preparatory to ordering the
start of my caravan, when I heard the ring of
metal on the flat stones of the street. A child
running past had dropped a small silver coin. I
marked the gleaming spot as the child ran on unheeding,
and naturally rushed to put my foot on it
before it should be noticed by any other, intending
to stoop gracefully at my leisure and pick it up
when the coast was clear. But the Evil One, who
is ever on the watch to undo the servants of the
Most High caused me, in my eagerness, to slip
upon a greasy piece of mud and I fell heavily upon
the stones with a crash. My leg was broken!</p>

<p>“In the agony I suffered I quite forgot the
silver coin (the void still aches); I know not who
acquired it. I cannot bear to think that it was
trampled in and lost to the world.</p>

<p>“At any rate, I was carried to my couch half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
fainting, the bone was set with excruciating pain,
and I lay for many days unable to rise and eating
my heart out at the added expense of my large
company which was dipping deeply into my store
of loose coin.</p>

<p>“My main treasure, stored in the hundred iron
boxes, I dared not touch; for the Chief of Skandir
(who daily visited my sick-room) told me that he
had affixed seals to the sand consigned to the Sultan
of Dirak, his powerful neighbour, and taken it
for safe keeping into his castle.</p>

<p>“The physician assured me that even when I
might venture out on crutches it would be fatal,
in view of certain complications which had arisen,
if I were to think of travel.</p>

<p>“So there I was, imprisoned in this charming
valley, with no chance of commerce, my spare cash
dangerously dwindling, and a most expensive
three weeks’ journey ahead of me before I could
reach my beloved Dirak!</p>

<p>“What was I to do!</p>

<p>“My dear nephews, you will hear many harsh
things said of those who prosper as I have done.
They are vilified through a base envy and the most
monstrous tales are told of them. But they are
under the protection of Heaven, and that Guiding
Power supplements their humble vows. None can
deny their ready response to Inspiration. Hear
what I did.</p>

<p>“First I purchased out of my remaining free
gold a fine house that happened to be empty. Next
I had painted on its front in beautiful and varied
colours ‘<span class="smcap">Mahmoud’s Bank</span>.’ Next I told the Chief
what advantage I designed for him and his during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
my enforced stay, by way of repaying him for
their exceptional kindness. Next I sent out written
letters to all the wealthier men (and women,
my dear nephews, <i>and women</i>), saying that I had
begun operations in the buying and selling of
market produce and that any capital entrusted to
me would earn, for every hundred pieces, one
piece a week, payed punctually at a certain hour.
To give colour to my scheme I sent my quickest-witted
servant (amply rewarded) to watch the
markets in the valley, to buy up fruit and grain at
magnificent prices and to sell elsewhere as best
he could.</p>

<p>“‘Never mind,’ said I to him, benevolently,
‘at what loss you sell. I desire to do these honest
people a service.’</p>

<p>“The volume of my commerce grew (at a heavy
charge!) and even the timid thought there might
be something in it. I started the ball rolling by
getting my confidant to deposit a hundred pieces
of gold, which I had privily furnished. At the end
of the week I duly gave him back one hundred and
one in the presence of many; and the story went
abroad.</p>

<p>“Soon the Chief, his uncle and his mother-in-law
deposited and were as regularly paid one per
cent a week. The thing began to buzz—but I
watched narrowly my dwindling hoard: it was a
close thing!... When I had progressed in this
fashion for what I considered a sufficient time, I
judged it opportune to initiate my new Policy of
An Expansion of Exchange through Instruments
of Credit.”</p>

<p>“Dear uncle——” interrupted the eldest
nephew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the merchant, impatiently, “I
know that the term is new to you, but you will
shortly learn its meaning. When I had occasion
to buy articles for my private consumption or to
make an exceptionally heavy purchase of my
wholesale wares, I would frequently affect embarrassment,
and approaching the vendor I would
beg him to accept, in lieu of immediate payment
in cash, a note which I had signed promising payment
in gold at sight. ‘For,’ said I to him, ‘in the
rapid turnover of my business it is but a matter
of a few hours for me to be again in possession of
a considerable sum of ready money.’</p>

<p>“I went to work at first with caution. I never
by any chance issued a single note for more than
ten pieces, and when ever any one of these notes
was presented for payment, even though that
event should take place within an hour of my issuing
it, I promptly honoured it from the reserve
of metal which I had kept back for the furtherance
of my plan. I was careful to make these
notes identical, to stamp them all in the same
place with my metal seal, and in every way to
make them, so far as I could, a sort of currency,
which, as you may imagine, they promptly became.
When a man carrying one of these instruments
might find himself called upon to pay, at some distance
from my place of business, he would at first
tentatively offer my note (perhaps at a small discount)
to his creditor. But as my integrity was
by this time a proverb (and never forget, dear
boys, that integrity is the soul of business) the
Notes were more and more readily accepted as
time proceeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>“The convenience of carrying such paper compared
with the heavy weight of metal they might
represent, the ease of negotiation, and so forth,
rapidly increased their circulation; and in a short
time I was able to calculate with assurance what
the experts in this amiable science term ‘the Rate
of Circulation’ which my notes had attained. I
found that, roughly speaking, for every five pieces
to which I had thus pledged myself upon paper
two were sufficient to meet the claims of those who
presented them at any one moment. And this proportion
is known to this day in that happy valley
as ‘the Proportion of Metallic Reserve’ which
must lie behind any Issue of Notes—but I hear
that since my departure they have got badly
muddled.</p>

<p>“Oh! dear, dear!” said the eldest nephew. “I
am getting muddled myself, Uncle.”</p>

<p>“Don’t listen to him!” said his brothers in
chorus.</p>

<p>“Yes! my children,” answered the old man vividly,
“it is indeed a difficult subject. Only a few
experts really understand it ... and I am one ...
anyhow, you all see that I could now make new
money as I chose out of nothing?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, uncle!” they all agreed, including
the eldest. “We quite see that!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said their revered relative in a subdued
tone, “that is a great advantage. But to
proceed.</p>

<p>“After some weeks of these practices I found
myself the master of the fruit and grain markets,
to which I added certain adjuncts naturally suggested
by it, such as catering for public meals, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
erection of mosques, the undertaking of marriages,
funerals, and divorces, the display of fireworks,
and the charging of fixed fees for the telling
of fortunes. This last soon became a very
flourishing branch of my business. I employed in
it at the customary wage a number of expert
soothsayers, and these, with the rest of my staff,
amounted to perhaps a quarter of the inhabitants;
nor were they the least contented or the least
prosperous of the population.</p>

<p>“In a word, my dear nephews, when my operations
were concluded I found myself in possession
of 200,000 pieces of gold, while my notes, which
were everywhere received throughout the State,
stood for 300,000 more. A simple calculation,”
said the worthy old man, smiling, “will show you
that my total new fortune was now no less than
half a million pieces, when signs of economic
exhaustion in the public and the complete healing
of my leg reluctantly decided me that the time had
come to seek fresh fields of effort and other undeveloped
lands.”</p>

<p>As the merchant now puffed at his pipe in
silence the fifth nephew begged leave to ask him
two questions which had perplexed his youthful
mind.</p>

<p>“Ask away, my little fellow,” said his uncle,
kindly, “and I will attempt to explain any difficulty
you have in simple terms suited to your
age.”</p>

<p>“Well, uncle,” said the fifth nephew, humbly,
“I cannot in the first place see how the 300,000
pieces of which you speak, and which as you say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
were represented by notes alone, constituted any
real wealth.”</p>

<p>“My dear little chap,” answered his uncle, leaning
forward to pat him upon the head, “you will
have the intelligence to perceive that wherever
such a note existed people thought of it as ten
golden pieces, did they not?”</p>

<p>“Ye-s-s,” answered his nephew, feeling that he
was getting cornered.</p>

<p>“Very well,” continued the old man, merrily,
“this attitude of mind being common to the whole
community, and all having come to regard these
pieces of paper as so much money, I had but to
receive them in payment of my debts and then to
buy with them into the gold of others. Thus all
the gold entered my possession. Eh? On my departure
the outstanding notes were presented to
the firm, I hear, and there was then no gold to meet
them with. A sad state of affairs! Many clamoured
and all sorts of trouble arose. But by that
time I was far away.”</p>

<p>The little chap still looked puzzled. “But,
uncle” he said, “when the people presented the
notes after you had gone, they may have thought
they had wealth, but they hadn’t any, had they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the old man, after a pause.
“It is a most difficult point in the discussion of
currency.... I, at any rate, had been bold in the
story I told, and got hold of their gold.”</p>

<p>“But the wealth wasn’t <i>there</i>, uncle,” persisted
the little boy. “It wasn’t there at all!”</p>

<p>The merchant with a benign air replied: “The
science of political economy is abstruse enough
for the most aged and experienced, and it will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
impossible for me to explain to you at length so
intricate a point. Let it suffice for you that so far
as <i>I</i> was concerned the wealth <i>was</i> there, it was
there in fifty large leather bags.... You had, I
think,” he added in a severer tone, “a second
question to propound?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said his nephew with a slight sigh,
“dear uncle, it was this: Why under such favorable
circumstances did you think it necessary to
leave so early, seeing that your new trade was going
so well?”</p>

<p>“That,” said old Mahmoud in a tone of relief,
“is much more easy to answer. My leg was
healed. The resources of Skandir were limited.
Signs were apparent that the worthy populace,
though unable to unravel the precise nature of
their entanglement, were already very seriously
hampered by my operations. Though I was able
to prove by statistics that prosperity had increased
by leaps and bounds, and though the
Chief, who was now my partner, kindly printed
pamphlets at the public expense to prove the
same, numbers who had formerly been well fed
were now reduced to a few handfuls of raw grain,
the jails were crammed, much of the land was
going out of cultivation, and what between the
ignorant passions which such periods of transition
arouse in the vulgar, and the inability to get more
water out of a sponge when you have already
squeezed it thoroughly dry, I am sure that I was
right in the determination I then took to retire
from this field of operations.</p>

<p>“Before leaving I offered my business for sale
to the public in general. The shares, I am glad to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
say, were eagerly taken up. And as I gave a preference
in allotment (another technical term) to
those who paid in my own notes, I recovered all
of these save an insignificant fraction, and was
able to negotiate them again for gold in public exchange
before my departure.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile the unscrupulous anxiety of the
chaotic multitude to share in so prosperous a commercial
undertaking as mine had been, permitted
me to ask for my business more than four (but
less than five) times the sum which I would myself
have been content to pay for it.</p>

<p>“I loaded 300 more camels with valuables of
various sorts, including nearly all the precious
metals discoverable in the State; I purchased a
whole army of new slaves for the conduct of the
caravan (paying for them in new notes issued
upon the new company), and amid the plaudits
and benedictions of a vast multitude, many of
whom (I regret to say) were now in the last
stages of destitution, I regretfully took my way
through the gorge and bade farewell to the simple
people of lovely and lonely Skandir to whom I
owed so much.”</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“I proceeded from the people of the valley
whom I had introduced to banking, and went out
through the gorge into the rising prairies beyond
the mountains. For at least four days’ march
beyond the valley my name was a household word
to the villages through which I passed; not only
was I able to pay for all goods by a further Issue
of Notes, but I would even reward any special
considerations shown me by selling to the grateful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
inhabitants for cash such shares in my old Firm
remaining at Skandir as I had retained to amuse
me in my travel; and these, I am happy to say,
went rapidly to a premium. These shares passed
at gradually lessening prices from hand to hand,
and I subsequently learnt that in a few months
they had become unsaleable. Those who suffered
in the last purchases had only themselves to
blame, and indeed did not think of blaming any
other, while the first to sell at a high price still
hold my name in reverent remembrance.</p>

<p>“When I had proceeded a few days further
upon my travels I found that the enlightenment
and civilization to which I had led the people of
the valley was gradually dissipated, and within a
fortnight I discovered myself amid the very brutish
nomad population who absolutely refused to
take paper in the place of cash, even when this
form of payment was offered by my own body
servants. On the other hand, the precious metals
were so scarce amid that population that prices
were extremely low, and I was able at a very
small outlay in gold to feed the whole of my considerable
concourse.</p>

<p>“Three weeks so passed in these monotonous
grass lands among the nomad tribes, the road
went forward to the east rising all the way, and
the soil grew drier and drier. We reached the
<span class="replace" id="tn_6" title="Probably the same location as the wells of Ayn-ayoum">wells of Ayn-Ayoub</span>
and filled our skins with water,
we traversed the desert belt and camped near the
summit: at daybreak we came to the escarpment
and saw the wooded slopes falling away in cascading
forests at our feet to where, far below, lay
the splendid plain of Dirak and in its midst, far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
off and dark in outline against the burning dawn,
the battlements and mosques, the minarets and
tapering cypress points of its capital Misawan.</p>

<p>“What joy was mine to fall by gentle gradations
down the declivities of those noble woods
into the warm fields of the Fortunate State! At
every hour of my advance new delights met my
eye! Great Country Houses standing in magnificent
parks with carefully tended lawns all about,
poor men who saluted low as I passed and rich
men here and there who glanced a moment in
haughty ease, fine horses passing at the trot
mounted by subservient grooms, and, continually,
posts bearing such notices as ‘Any one treading
on this Lord’s ground will be bowstrung.’ ‘No
spitting.’ ‘One insolent word and to jail with
you!’: While at every few hundred yards an
armed man, before whom the poorer people cowered,
would frown at the slaves at the head of my
column, and then, seeing my finely mounted guard
and my own immutable face and shining garments
coming up behind them, would smile and bow and
hint at a few small coins—which I gave.</p>

<p>“In truth the Learned Man had not deceived
me! This land of Dirak was a Paradise!</p>

<p>“I rode into the city like a king (as I was—for
my wealth made me one in such a State) and took
for the night a lodging in an Immense Building,
which called itself a Caravanserai, but was, to
the Caravanserais of my experience, as the Sultan’s
Palace to a horse.</p>

<p>“There, in an apartment of alabaster and
beaten silver, I eat such viands as I had not
thought to be on this earth, while well-drilled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
slaves, trained by long starvation to obedience,
moved noiselessly in and out or played soft music
hidden behind a carven screen.</p>

<p>“Oh! Dirak! Dirak!... but I must conclude....
The matter was not long. With my gold I
purchased my palace in the midst of this city of
Misawan, entertained guests who asked nothing
of my origin, bought (after a careful survey of
prices) the excellent post of Chief Sweeper to his
Majesty (which carried with it the conduct of The
Treasury) and paid for a few laws which happened
to suit my convenience, such as one to prevent
street cries and another for the strangling of
the red-headed poor: it is a colour of hair I cannot
abide.</p>

<p>“From time to time I paid my respects to that
puppet called the Sultan and bowed low in the
Ceremonies of the Court.</p>

<p>“I had no occasion to hide my wealth since
wealth was here immune and the criterion of
honour. I displayed it openly. I boasted of its
amount. I even exaggerated its total. I was,
within two years, the Chief Man in the State.</p>

<p>“Yet (such is the heart of man!) I was not
wholly satisfied. Of my vast fortune not a hundredth
had been consumed. None the less I could
not bear to let it lie idle. I was determined to do
business once again!—By the Infinite Mercy of
Allah the opportunity was vouchsafed.</p>

<p>“There lay on the confines of Dirak another
State, called Har, very different. In this the
Sultan was the wealthiest man in the community
and a tyrant. Moreover it differed from Dirak in
this important particular, that whereas in Dirak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
all office was obtained by purchase, in Har all
office was obtained by inheritance, so that between
the two lay the unending and violent quarrel between
trickery and pride.</p>

<p>“One day—I had been the greatest man in
Dirak for already two years more—the Sultan of
Har, wickedly, insolently, and not having the fear
of God before his eyes, demanded satisfaction of
the Sultan of Dirak for a loss sustained at dice by
his Grand Almoner’s nephew at the hands of that
Noble in Dirak called the Lord Persecutor of
Games of Chance—which are, in Dirak, strictly
forbidden by law.</p>

<p>“In vain did the Sultan of Dirak implore the
aid of his Nobles: they assured him that none
would dare attack his (and their) Onmipotent
State.</p>

<p>“On the third day the Sultan of Har crossed
the frontier with one million, two hundred thousand
and fifty-seven men, ninety-seven elephants,
and two catapults. On the tenth he was but three
days’ march from
<span class="replace" id="tn_4" title="In the printed book: Masawan">Misawan</span>.</p>

<p>“The unfortunate Sultan of Dirak, pressed by
his enemy, was at his wits’ end for the ready
money wherewith to conduct the war. He had
already so severely taxed his poor that they were
upon the point of rebellion, while the rich were
much rather prepared to make terms with the
enemy or to fly than to support his whim of
honour, patriotism and the rest.</p>

<p>“Musing upon the opportunity thus afforded,
and recognizing in it once more that overshadowing
Mercy which had so marvellously aided my
every step in life, I came into the street upon a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
horse and in my noblest garments. I was careful
to throw largesse to the crowd, at an expense
which I had previously noted in a little book (your
father has, my dear nephews, trained you, I hope,
to keep accounts?), and riding up to the Palace I
announced to the guard that I had come with
important news for the Sultan and his Council.
After certain formalities (which cost me, I regret
to say, no less than fifteen dinars more than I had
allowed for) I was shown into the presence of
the Vizier, who begged me to despatch my business
hurriedly as the Sultan was expecting at
any moment news of an important action. I said
with courtesy and firmness that my time was my
own, that perhaps I had been mistaken in the news
conveyed to me, but that the financial operations
I was prepared to undertake would demand a certain
leisure before they could be completed.</p>

<p>“At the words ‘financial operations’ the
Vizier’s manner wholly changed; he was profuse
in apologies, admitting a little shamefacedly that
he had taken me for a soldier, a priest, a poet, or
something of that sort, and that if he had had the
least idea of my intent he would never have kept
me waiting as he had unfortunately done. He proceeded
in a hurried and conventional tone to discuss
the weather, the latest scandal, and other
matters of the sort, until at my own time I proposed
to introduce the important subject.</p>

<p>“This I did with becoming dignity. I informed
him with the utmost reluctance that the enemy had
already approached me for financial assistance. I
would not be so hypocritical (I said) as to pretend
that I had refused them, or indeed that I had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
any sentimental preference for one side or the
other. As I thus expressed myself the Vizier
constantly and gravely nodded, as who should
say that he esteemed no man so much as one who
showed himself indifference to the feelings of the
vulgar. I next asked of what sum the Government
was in immediate need, and on hearing that it
amounted to about a quarter of my total capital I
put on a very grave look and said that I feared
the immediate provision of so large an amount
was hardly possible, in view of the poverty and
embarrassment of his unhappy country.</p>

<p>“When I rose as though to leave, the Vizier, in
a state of the utmost excitement, implored me to
reconsider so sudden a decision. He was prepared
(he swore) to take but an instalment of the
whole. Ready money was absolutely necessary.
And if, with my profound knowledge of finance,
I could devise some way of escape for his master,
the most substantial proofs of gratitude would be
afforded me.</p>

<p>“Upon hearing this I professed to be plunged
into profound thought for about a quarter of an
hour, and ended by slowly laying before him as an
original and masterly plan the following proposal:</p>

<p>“The poor (he had admitted) were taxed beyond
the limits of endurance, and were even upon
the point of revolt; the rich were hiding their
hoards, and many forms of portable wealth were
leaving the country. Let him abandon these uncouth
and rapacious methods of obtaining revenue,
and ask the wealthier of the loving subjects
of the Sovereign to <i>lend</i> him at interest what they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
would certainly refuse to pay him outright. In
this way a smaller annual sum by far than was
now raised to meet the exigencies of the war
would suffice to meet the obligations of the Government.
The capital so raised would be spent
upon the campaign; the charge imposed upon the
people would, it is true, be perpetual; but it
would be so much smaller than the existing taxation
as to be everywhere welcomed.</p>

<p>“The Vizier sadly responded that though he
would be very happy to undertake such a course
he feared that the wealthy inhabitants would
never lend (knowing, as they did, the embarrassment
of the Government) save upon ruinous
terms.</p>

<p>“I had been waiting for this confession, and
I at once suggested that I could act as go-between.
I would, said I, stand guarantor. My great wealth
would at once restore opinion, the loan would certainly
be taken up, and I should only make the
nominal charge of five gold pieces every year for
each hundred I had thus guaranteed.</p>

<p>“The Vizier was so astounded at my generosity
that he almost fell backward, but recovering himself,
he poured forth the most extravagant thanks,
which were hardly marred by the look I detected
in his eye, a look certainly betraying the belief
that such an offer from a commercial man could
hardly be made in good faith. To reassure him I
adopted what is known in the financial world as
the Seventh, or Frankly Simple, tone. I told him
without reserve the total of my wealth (which I
put at a fifth of its real amount) and promised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
to bring it in cash to offices which he should permit
me to establish in the city.</p>

<p>“Entering the next day with a million pieces of
gold charged upon a train of very heavily laden
camels, I set up my bank in the most crowded
portion of the Bazaar, published news of my intention
to support the Government, inviting the
public inspection of the metal so lent, and at the
same time proposing that any who desired regular
interest of four pieces guaranteed by myself
annually upon every hundred should come forward
to take the loan off my hands. The hoards
of gold still remaining in the country reappeared
as though by magic—so much more delightful is
it to lend voluntarily at interest than to pay away
under torture for ever—and at last there applied
at my office for the favour of extending a loan ten
times as many citizens as the situation required.</p>

<p>“My terms with the Government were simple,
and, I am sure, moderate. All that I asked was
that the tax collectors should in future pay their
receipts into my chest, from which I pledged myself
to hand over to the Government whatever
surplus there might be after I had paid to the
lenders their annual interest, four pieces, and kept
for myself a fifth piece, which formed my tiny
and not unearned commission.</p>

<p>“In this way I rapidly repaid myself and also
took one piece on every hundred <i>others</i> had subscribed.
The learned men of the place, who had
never before imagined so simple and practical a
plan, treated me with almost supernatural reverence.
I was consulted upon every operation of
war, my guarantee was eagerly sought for in other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
financial ventures, and I was able, I am glad to
say, to secure other commissions without touching
a penny of my treasure—I had but to hold it
forth as a proof of good faith.</p>

<p>“The enemy was repelled. But victory was not
won. The war dragged on for a year and there
was no decision. Gold grew scarce, and again the
Government was in despair.</p>

<p>“I easily relieved them. ‘Write,’ I said, ‘promises
on paper to be repaid in gold.’ They did as
I advised—paying me (at my request) a trifle
of half a million for the advice. I handled the
affair—on a merely nominal profit. I punctually
met for another year every note that was paid in.
But too many were presented, for the war seemed
unending and entered a third year.</p>

<p>“Then did I conceive yet another stupendous
thing. ‘Bid them,’ said I to the Sultan, ‘take the
notes as money. Cease to repay. Write, not “I
will on delivery of this paper pay a piece of gold,”
but, “this <i>is</i> a piece of gold.”’</p>

<p>“He did as I told him. The next day the Vizier
came to me with the story of an insolent fellow
to whom fifty such notes had been offered as payment
for a camel for the war and who had sent
back, not a camel, but another piece of paper on
which was written ‘This <i>is</i> a camel.’</p>

<p>“‘Cut off his head!’ said I.</p>

<p>“It was done, and the warning sufficed. The
paper was taken and the war proceeded.</p>

<p>“It was I that prepared the notes, and on each
batch I exacted my necessary commission, my
little commission, my due.</p>

<p>“It was not in my nature, dear nephews, how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>ever,
in those days of hard and honest work, to lie
idle. When I had put the Sultan on his legs it
occurred to me that the <i>enemy’s Government</i> was
also very probably in similar straits. I therefore
visited the enemy’s capital by a roundabout route,
and concluded with the Vizier of that opulent but
agitated State a similar bargain.</p>

<p>“The war thus replenished at its sources raged
with redoubled ardour, for ten more years,
and....”</p>

<p>“But, uncle,” said the fourth nephew, who was
an athlete and somewhat stupid, and who had
heard of this double negotiation with round eyes,
“surely they must have both been very angry
with you!”</p>

<p>The excellent Mahmoud raised his left hand in
protest. “Dear lad!” cried he, “how little you
know the world! Angry? Why, each regarded
me in the first place as a genius whose ways it
was impossible to unravel, in the second place as a
public necessity, in the third as a benefactor arrived
at a miraculous moment; and as for the fact
that I was aiding both sides, I have only to tell
you that among the people of that region it is
thought the proper part of all financiers to act in
this fashion. I should have been treated with
deserved contempt had I betrayed any scruples
upon so simple a matter. Nay, I am sure that
either party reposed the greater trust in me from
the fact that my operations were thus universal....
But to proceed:</p>

<p>“The Mercy of Allah was never more apparent
in my career than in the way these two Sultans
and their subjects fought like raging dogs upon
the proceeds of those loans which the wealthy citi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>zens
upon either side had provided, and upon the
mountains of paper which I spent half the day
in signing.</p>

<p>“These loans increased ten, twenty, thirty-fold.
It was always I that guaranteed them; I had not
to risk or expend one miserable dinar of my horde,
and yet yearly my commission came rolling in, in
larger and larger amounts, until at last the arduous
but glorious campaigns were terminated in the
total exhaustion of one of the two combatants (at
this distance of time I forget which), and his
territory and capital were laid under an enormous
indemnity (which I again financed without the
tedium of myself producing any actual metal of
my own). As the beaten State might have repudiated
its obligations I was careful to meet the
patriotic clamours of the victorious populace, and
to see that the territory of the vanquished should
be annexed. You appreciate the situation, my
dear fellow?” said the aged Mahmoud conversationally
to his eldest nephew.</p>

<p>“I think so, uncle,” said the lad doubtfully,
screwing up his face.</p>

<p>“It is quite simple,” said the wealthy old man,
clearing his throat. “The peoples of both States
(now happily united) were taxed to their utmost
capacity; the one strong and united Government
guaranteed a regular revenue; a proportion
of this revenue was annually distributed as a <i>fixed</i>
income to the wealthy few who had subscribed my
loans; another portion, amounting by this time
annually to considerably more than my original
capital, was retained in my coffers; and the
mechanism of this was the more simple from the
fact that all the public revenues passed through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
my own hands as State Banker before any surplus
was handed over to the Crown.”</p>

<p>The old man ceased. His benevolent lips were
murmuring a prayer.</p>

<p>At this moment the hideous call for prayer
from the minaret would no longer be denied, and
the seven boys, plunged in profound thought, retired
slowly to the poverty-stricken home of the
physician, their father. They found him tired
out with having sat up all night at the sick-bed
of a howling dervish, who in his last dying whisper
(and that a hoarse one), had confessed his
total inability to pay the customary fee.</p>

merchant to his nephews when they were
once more seated round him for the last of these
entertaining relations. “We had arrived, my

<p>“My position (if you recollect) at the close of
this adventure was that without having spent any
money of my own I was now receiving permanently
and for ever a very large yearly revenue
set aside from the taxes of both States.</p>

<p>“Not a man reaped or dug or carried heavy
water jars under the hot sun, not a man groomed
a horse or bent under the weight of a pack, not
a man added brick to brick or mixed mortar, not
a man did any useful act from one end of the
State to the other, but some part of his toil was
done for me, and this state of affairs was, as I
have said, as fixed and permanent as human
things can be.</p>

<p>“I was therefore what even financiers call well-to-do;
one way with another I was now worth
perhaps twenty million pieces of gold: but that is
but guess work, it may have been twenty-five.</p>

<p>“You might imagine that I would have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
content from that day onwards to repose in my
opulence.</p>

<p>“I might well have been tempted to do so, for
to that opulence was added a singular and fervid
popularity. I was alluded to in public and private
as the man who had saved the State by his financial
genius during the Great War. Even the conquered
remembered me gratefully for the aid I
had extended to them in their need; while since I
could not satisfy my personal desires without at
least feeding a great host of dancers, bearers, artists,
my kindness in affording employment was
universally recognized; moreover (since among
these people wealth is a test of greatness) I was
admitted to their Senate without the usual formality
of a cash payment.</p>

<p>“The world was now indeed at my feet. But
you must know,” continued Mahmoud with something
of sadness in his voice, “you must know,
my dear, innocent lads, that wealth will not stop
still. The mere administration of a great fortune
tends to increase it, and when one has for years
found one’s occupation in the accumulation of
money, it is difficult in middle age to abandon the
rooted habit. Therefore, though I now had all
that life could give me, I proceeded henceforward
for many years to increase that substance with
which the Mercy of Allah had provided me; and
I discovered at the outset of this new career that
to be the financier I had become, and to have
behind me the resources which I now possessed,
made my further successes a matter not of hazard
but of certitude. Shall I briefly tell you the various
ways in which my efforts proceeded?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pray, pray do so,” said his little nephews with
sparkling eyes, each imagining himself in the
dazzling position of his wealthy relative.</p>

<p>“Very well,” sighed Mahmond. “It will be of
little use to any of you; but if it does no more than
confirm you in your religion what I have to tell
you will not have been told in vain.”</p>

<p>The merchant was silent for a moment, and
then began the category of his financial proceedings:</p>

<p>“Neighbouring States which had heard of the
powerful new methods I had introduced would
approach me from time to time for financial
assistance. To these I made the same invariable
reply, that upon certain terms, which I myself
would fix, I was content to ‘float their loans’;
that is, the rich men of their country (or of any
other) should pay into my office the sums they
were prepared to lend to such a State, and I would
pay back a part, but not the whole, of the amount
so accumulated to the State in question. The
enormous service I rendered by allowing my office
to be used for this transaction was everywhere
recognized, and by such operations my fortunes
proceeded to grow.</p>

<p>“It was at this moment in my career that I
married my wife, your dear aunt, who generally
resides, as you know, in that one of my country
palaces called Dar-al-Beida on the banks of the
Tigris some four days’ journey from here. It is
a delightful spot which I remember well though
I have not seen it for years.... Some day, perhaps,
I will visit it again, but not to sleep.</p>

<p>“Your dear aunt was, and is, my boys, a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
remarkable woman: fit to compete with the master
spirits of our time: yea! even with my own.</p>

<p>“Her birth—I need not conceal it—was humble.
She was but a chance hireling in my offices, with
the duty of sorting my papers and keeping indices
of the same.</p>

<p>“Such was her interest in affairs that she was
at the pains to take copies and tracings of many
particularly private and important passages with
her own hand, and keep these by her in a private
place. I was struck beyond measure at such industry
and preoccupation with business on the
part of a woman (and one so poor!). I conceived
an ardent desire to possess these specimens
of her skill; but—to my astonishment, and
(at first) confusion—she humbly replied that a
profound though secret affection which she had
conceived for me forbade her to part with these
precious souvenirs of myself. I was so absorbed
in their pursuit that, rather than lose them, I married
this Queen of Finance—recognizing in her
an equal genius with my own. Our wedding was
of the simplest. I took comfort from the consideration
that it proved me superior to all the nobles
of the court and indifferent to an alliance with
their families.</p>

<p>“Immediately after the wedding my wife, your
dear aunt, asked me for money wherewith to
travel, a request I readily granted. She traversed
for her pleasure I knew not what foreign lands,
always, and gladly, furnished with the wherewithal
from my cash box; but on my returning
later to Bagdad, my native place, she unexpectedly
appeared at my door, and I was happy to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
build for her that country Palace of Dar-al-Beida
to the charm of which I have alluded. Unfortunately
its air suits me ill, while she (your dear
aunt) suffocates in the atmosphere of Bagdad. It
is often thus in old age....”</p>

<p>Mahmoud mused and continued:</p>

<p>“But let us return to my further activities in
that far land:</p>

<p>“I next designed a scheme whereby every form
of human misfortune, fire, disease, paralysis, madness,
and the rest, might be alleviated to the
sufferer by the payment of regular sums of money
upon the advent of the disaster; weekly sums for
his support if he were rendered infirm or ill, a
lump sum to replace whatever he might have
totally lost, and so forth. A short and easy survey
of the average number of times in which such
accidents took place permitted me to establish
my system. I charged for 100 dinars worth of
such insurance 110 dinars, and my benevolence
was praised even more highly than my ingenuity.</p>

<p>“Men flocked in thousands, and at last in millions,
to secure themselves from the uncertainty
of human life by giving me of their free will more
money in regular payments than I could by any
accident be compelled to pay out to any one of
them upon his reaching old age, his suffering from
fire, or his contraction of an illness. Nay, death
itself at last entered into this design, and having
found that young men just of age live upon the
average for forty years, I asked them to pay for
their heirs annual sums calculated as though that
period were thirty, and thus I continued to accumulate
wealth from a perennial source.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>“But why,” began one of his nephews excitedly....</p>

<p>“Why <i>what</i>?” asked his uncle, severely.</p>

<p>“Why,” said the poor lad, a little abashed by
his uncle’s tone, “why did they pay you more for
a thing than it was worth?”</p>

<p>Mahmoud stroked his long white beard and
looked up sideways towards the highly decorated
vault of the gorgeous apartment. He remained
thus plunged in thought for perhaps thirty seconds,
and when he broke the silence it was to say
that he did not know. “But no matter——” he
added hurriedly. “I paid for a law which compelled
all slaves to insure and so was certain of
a fixed revenue in this kind.</p>

<p>“And I had many other resources,” he continued
cheerily. “If those who had made many
such regular payments to me to insure against
death, old age, disease, and the rest, happened
to fall into an embarrassed condition and to need
a loan, I was always ready to advance them their
own money again at interest, or did I ever find
them unwilling to subscribe the bond. Further
I urged and tempted many to fall into arrears
and so possessed myself of all they had paid in.
The vast sums paid to me in these various fashions
were sometimes too great for investment
within the State, and I had to look further afield.
But here again by the Mercy of Allah suggestions
of the most lucrative sort perpetually occurred
to my religious soul.</p>

<p>“Not infrequently I would lay out a million
or two in the purchase of a great estate situated
at some distance which, when I had acquired it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
I would declare to be packed with gold, silver,
diamonds, copper, salt, and china clay beneath the
earth, and on its surface loaded with red pepper
and other most precious fruits. I have no doubt
these estates were often of a promising nature,
though travellers have assured me that some were
mere desert; in one case, to my certain knowledge,
the estate did not even exist. But it really mattered
little whether I spoke truly or falsely with
regard to such ventures, for my method of dealing
with them made them, whether they were of
trifling value or of more, invariably profitable to
many besides myself and a blessing to the whole
State.”</p>

<p>“But uncle,” interjected another nephew, “how
could that be?”</p>

<p>“You will easily see,” said Mahmoud with a
pitying smile, “when you hear the sequel. I was
not so selfish as to retain these properties in my
own hands. I would offer them to the public for
sale, and being in a position to pay many poets,
scribes, and public story tellers who should make
general the praises of the estates in question, an
active competition among many thousands would
arise to become part purchasers. In the presence
of this competition the price of a share, or part
property, would rise; those who had bought
early would sell later to others at a profit, and
these to others again at a further profit still; an
active buying and selling of these part properties
in my ventures thus became a fixed habit in the
intelligent people of the place, and those who
were left ultimately the possessors of the actual
estates in question, whether real or imaginary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
were only the more foolish and ignorant of the
population. Their agonized denouncement of my
judgment (as they wandered from one to another
attempting to dispose of their bad bargains) was,
of course, treated with contempt by the run of
able men who remembered the profits of the share
market at the inception of the business. On this
account it was possible for me to continue indefinitely
to present for sale to the public every
species of venture which I might feel inclined to
put before them: the intelligent and successful
were ever my applauders; the unfortunate and
despised alone decried me. And these were, on
account of my operations, so poor, and therefore
of so little significance in the State, that I rarely
thought it worth while to pay the authorities for
their imprisonment or death.</p>

<p>“Within ten years there were no bounds to my
possessions. It was currently said that I myself
had no conception of their magnitude, and I admit
this was true. From time to time I would pay
enormous sums to endow a place of learning, to
benefit the Ministers of my own Religion (and
its antagonists), or to propagate by means of an
army of public criers some insignificant opinion
peculiar to myself or my wife, your dear aunt—whose
strong views upon the wearing of green
turbans by Hadjis and the illumination of the
Koran in red ink are doubtless familiar to you.</p>

<p>“I would also put up vast buildings to house
the aged indigent whose name began with an A,
or others wherein could be set to useful labour the
aged indigent who were blind of one eye.</p>

<p>“I erected, endowed and staffed an immense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
establishment, standing in its own park-like
grounds, wherein was taught and proved the true
doctrine that gold and silver are but dross and
that learning is the sole good; and yet others in
which it was proved with equal certitude that
learning, like <i>all</i> mundane things, is dust and only
an exact knowledge of the Sacred Text worth
having. But the Professors of this last science
demanded double pay, urging (with sense, I
thought) <i>first</i> that any fool could talk at large but
that it took hard work to study manuscripts;
<i>second</i> that only half a dozen men knew the documents
exhaustively and that if they were under-rated
they would stand aside and wreck the enterprise
with their savage critiques.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile I devised in my leisure time an
amusing instrument of gain called ‘The Cream
Separator.’ I paid my wretched Sultan and his
Court for a law, to be imposed, compelling all
men, under pain of torture, to reveal their revenues
from farming or any other reputable trade,
but taking no account of gambling and juggling
as being unimportant and too difficult to follow.
I next paid another sum to the writers and
spouters and other starvelings to denounce all
who objected. For less than double this sum I
brought a new law which swept away all the surplus
of the better farmers and other reputable
men into a general fund and paid out their cruel
loss, partly in little doles to the very poor, but
partly also (for fair play’s a jewel) in added stipends
to the very rich with posts at Court: the
Lord High Conjurer I especially favoured. Thus
did I establish a firm friendship with the masses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
and with their governors and, I am glad to say,
destroyed the middle sort who are a very dull,
greasy, humdrum lot at the best, rightly detested
by their betters as apes and by their inferiors as
immediate masters.</p>

<p>“And on all this I took my little commission....</p>

<p>“My children!... My children!...” ended
the old man, his eyes now full of frigid tears, “I
had attained the summit of Human Life. I had
all ... and there descended upon me what
wealth—supreme wealth—alone can give: the
Strong Peace of the Soul.”</p>

<p>His tears now flowed freely, and his nephews
were touched beyond measure to see such emotion
in one so great.</p>

<p>“It is,” he continued (with difficulty from his
rising emotion), “it is wealth and wealth alone,
wealth superior to all surrounding wealth, that
can procure for man that equal vision of the
world, that immense tolerance of evil, that unfailing
hope for the morrow, and that profound
content which furnish for the heart of man its
resting place.”</p>

<p>Here the millionaire frankly broke down. He
covered his face in his hands and his sobs were
echoed by those of his respectful nephews, with
the exception of the third with whom they degenerated
into hiccoughs.</p>

<p>Mahmoud raised his strong, old, tear-stained
features, dried his eyes and asked them (since his
tale was now done) whether they had any questions
to ask.</p>

<p>After a long interval the eldest spoke:</p>

<p>“Oh! My revered uncle,” said he, in an awe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>struck
voice, “if I may make so bold ... why did
you leave this place of your power and return to
Bagdad?”</p>

<p>His uncle was silent for a space and then replied
in slow and measured words:</p>

<p>“It was in this wise. A sort of moral distemper—a
mysterious inward plague—struck the people
among whom I dwelt. The poor, in spite of
their increased doles, seemed to grow mysteriously
disinclined for work. The rich—and
especially those in power—fell (I know not why!)
into habits of self-indulgence. The middle class,
whom I had so justly destroyed, were filled in
their ruin with a vile spite and rancour. As they
still commanded some remaining power of expression
by pen and voice they added to the great
ill ease. One evening an awful thing happened.
A large pebble—one may almost call it a stone—was
flung through the open lattice of my banqueting
room and narrowly missed the Deputy Head
Controller who stood behind the couch where I
reclined at the head of my guests.</p>

<p>“It was a warning from Heaven. Next day I
began with infinite precautions to realize. I knew
that, for some hidden reason, the country was
poisoned. Parcel by parcel, lot by lot, I disposed
of my lands, my shares in enterprises, my documents
of mortgage and loan. By messengers I
transferred this wealth to purchases in the plains
about Bagdad, my native place; on the Tigris;
Bonds upon the Houses of Mosul and mills on the
farm colonies of the Persian hills: In Promises
to Pay signed by the Caliph and in the admitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
obligations of the Lords of Bosra and the
Euphrates.</p>

<p>“An Inner Voice said to me, ‘Mahmoud, you
have achieved the Peace of the Soul. Do not risk
it longer here.’...</p>

<p>“When all my vast fortune was so transferred
to Mesopotamia, I went down by a month’s
journey to the sea-coast, took ship, and sailed up
the gulf for the home of my childhood....</p>

<p>“I was but just in time! Within a week of my
departure an insolent message was received by
the Sultan of my former habitation from the Robber
King of the Hills demanding tribute. In vain
did the unfortunate man plead his progress in the
arts, his magnificent national debt, the high wages
of his artisans and their happy leisure, the refinement
and luxury of his nobles—not even their hot
baths and their change of clothes three times a
day could save them! The cruel barbarian conqueror
over-ran the whole place, sacked the capital,
confiscated the land, annulled all deeds, imposed
a fearful tribute, and had I left one copper
coin in the country (which happily I had not),
it would have been lost to me for ever.</p>

<p>“But by the time these dreadful things were
taking place I was safe here in Bagdad—it was
about the time the eldest of you was born. I
purchased this site, built the Palace where you do
me the honour of attending me (and also that of
Dar-al-Beida for my wife, your dear aunt, four
days away) and have now lived serenely into old
age, praising and blessing God.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>“My dear nephews, I have no more to tell.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
You have now heard how industry in itself is nothing
if it is not guided and sustained by Providence,
but you have doubtless also perceived that
the best fortune which Heaven” (here the old man
bowed his head reverently) “can bestow upon a
mortal is useless indeed unless he supplement its
grace by his own energy and self-discipline. I
must warn you in closing that any efforts of your
own to tread in the path I have described would
very probably end in your suffering upon the market
place of the city that ignominious death which
furnishes in the public executions such entertainment
to the vulgar. If, indeed, you can pass the
first stages of your career without suffering anything
more fatal than the bastinado you might
reach at last some such great position as I occupy.
Indeed,” mused the kindly old man, “Hareb, my
junior partner, and Muktahr, whom you have
heard called ‘The Camel King,’ have each been
bastinadoed most severely in the past, when their
operations were upon a smaller scale.... But we
are content to forget such things.</p>

<p>“I have no more to tell you. Work as hard as
you possibly can, live soberly and most minutely
by rule, and so long as any dregs of strength remain
to you struggle to retain some small part of
the product of your labour for the support of
yourselves and your families. The rest will, in
the natural course of things, find its way into the
hands of men like myself.... And now depart
with my benediction. But, stay,” he said, as
though a thought had struck him, “I cannot let
you go without a little present for each.”</p>

<p>So saying, the kindly old man went to a cup<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>board
of beautiful inlaid work, and drawing from
it seven dried figs in the last stages of aridity and
emaciation, he presented one to each of his
nephews, who received the gift with transports of
gratitude and affection.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to take their leave the
youngest boy (a child, it will be remembered, of
but tender years), approached his uncle with a
beautiful mixture of humility and love, and bringing
out a paper which he had secreted in the folds
of his tunic, begged the merchant to sign his name
in it and date it too, as a souvenir of these delightful
mornings.</p>

<p>“With all my heart, my little fellow,” said
Mahmoud, patting him upon the head and reflecting
that such good deeds cost nothing and are
their own regard.</p>

<p>This done, the boys departed.</p>

<p class="tb">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Next morning, on Mahmoud sending a slave to
his cashier for the sum required to pay a band of
Kurdish Torturers whom he desired to hire for
his debtors’ prison, he was annoyed to receive
the reply that there was no cash immediately
available, a large draft signed by him having
been presented that very morning and duly honoured.
As the sum was considerable, and as the
payment had been made but a few moments
before, the cashier begged his master to wait for
half an hour or so until more metal could be procured
from a neighbouring deposit.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Mahmoud searched his memory
for the signature of any such instrument. He
was puzzled and suspected a forgery. At last he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
determined that the paper should be sent for and
put before him. There, sure enough was his signature;
but the sum of 20,000 dinars therein mentioned
was in another and most childish hand.
Then did it suddenly break upon the great Captain
of Industry that the tiny child, his youngest
nephew, who had asked for his autograph as a
souvenir, was not wholly unworthy of the blood
which he had collaterally inherited.... He wrote
to the boy’s father and secured the little fellow’s
services as office-boy at nothing-a-week. He
watched his developing talent, and was not disappointed.
Long before the lad was full grown
he had got every clerk of the great business house
into his debt and had successfully transferred to
his own secret hiding-place the savings of the porter,
the carrier and the aged widow who cleaned
the place of a morning. By his seventeenth year
he had brought off a deal in fugitive slaves, taking
equal amounts from the culprits for hiding and
from the masters for betraying them. By his
eighteenth he had control of a public bath where
clients were watched by spies and thus furnished
a source of ample revenue. Before he was of age
he had astonished and delighted his now more
than octogenarian uncle by selling him, under a
false name and through a man of straw, a ship
due to arrive at Bosra, but, as a fact, sunk off
Bushire five days before.</p>

<p>In every way he showed himself worthy of his
uncle’s confirmed reliance on his commercial
prowess. When the lad came of age, the Venerable
Mahmoud gave a feast of unexampled splendour
which foreshadowed his intentions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>For, indeed, but a month later, the old man
began to fail, and in a few weeks more was warned
by his physicians of approaching death. He summoned
scribes to his bed, dictated in a firm voice
his Will, wherein (after reciting provision already
made—under heavy pressure—for his wife) he
left to the youngest nephew the whole of his
wealth, saying with his last breath, “Allah! Creator
and Lord! Lest the Talent should fall into
unworthy hands!”</p>
